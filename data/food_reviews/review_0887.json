Since my doctor told me I couldn't drink caffein anymore I was forlorned....but then I realized that what I really enjoy about a good cup of coffee is the flavor, not the caffein.  And WOW this coffee tastes so wonderful.  It will be my go-to coffee everyday!  I HIGHLY recommend it!  And, by the way, the k-cup worked perfectly.  I love their filter.  It is very high quality.  Thanks Brooklyn Bean Roastery!!!"}
