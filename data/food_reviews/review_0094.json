The package says that half a packet is for 16 ounces of water and has two servings per packet.<br /><br />I used them in 32oz of water the first time however, it was sweet enough that I cut back to a little more than half a packet for 32oz and it still had a nice sweetness.<br /><br />It's a great product and I would purchase it without any reservation."}
