I love Lipton tea! I do not love Lipton To Go Stix tea...  Lipton's new \"To Go\" Stix are a great idea for travel and the flavor of the tea and fruits together are great. However, the sweetener used in this product is not so great.  I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, especially sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose IS an artificial sweetener. The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body and therefore it is non-caloric. Sucralose is approximately 600 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar),twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3 times as sweet as aspartame and BOY does it show.  I tried mixing this in different quantities of water and just did not enjoy it one bit.<br /><br />If the product was REALLY sweetened with honey, I would certainly enjoy it more. These packets are ACTAULLY 10 calories as opposed to the stated 5 as each stick is labelled for 8 oz instead of 16 oz.  There is also a problem in the dissolving properties of the sucralose.<br /><br />Purchase at your own risk..."}
