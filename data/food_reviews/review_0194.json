This is coming from someone that loves a good cup of coffee and I love this one. We love the dark coffees in the kcups with this one is comparable and a great price. I'm not sure what residue people are talking about- there's nothing to complain about for sure. And the fact that this is a filter and not a giant plastic cup... Awesome! I wish the coffee snobs and the wine snobs would just taste and enjoy their drinks! This coffee deserves 5 stars- 5 for flavor, 5 for cost, and 5 for saving plastic!"}
