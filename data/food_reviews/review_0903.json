I don't know if the problem is the size of the grind or some problem with the K-cup containers themselves, but almost every cup I have tried to make has been virtually unuseable.<br /><br />The water barely drips from the K-cup while brewing instead of producing a steady stream as other containers do. On at least two occasions the back-pressure was so high as to cause my brewer to overflow out of the top of the K-cup container because the brew could not be pushed through the K-cup as it should be.  Both holes were punched in the K-cup correctly and the holes in the needles are NOT obstructed.  I can remove the Brooklyn K-cup and insert any other one I have and it will flow correctly.  I have two brewers and the problem is the same in both brewers.<br /><br />In addition to the over-flow and back-pressure problems, every cup I have brewed has also contained a significant portion of coffee grounds in the cup, several cups have been so full of grounds as to be undrinkable.  This leads me to believe that at least part of the problem is the size of the grind.<br /><br />I've used almost half the box trying to get things to work to no avail, but I don't feel I can request a refund after using that much of the product.  I have no interest in replacement product as the flavor is not that special and I don't trust it to work any better.<br /><br />I cannot in good conscience recommend this coffee to anyone."}
