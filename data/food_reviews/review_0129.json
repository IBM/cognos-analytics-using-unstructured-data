I assumed I would be getting a \"Tea and Honey\" drink with a slight flavor of Strawberry.  Instead, I feel as though I received a strawberry flavored water drink less any sort of tea and honey flavor.  For those of you who might have tried other products similar to this (Crystal Light) it is very close to the same in my opinion.  Now, if you hate plain water this might be perfect for you!  Just don't expect a dramatic taste difference because the words \"Tea & Honey\" are printed on the box.<br /><br />The product does not always \"completely\" dissolve unless you keep stirring or really shake your water bottle but I didn't notice those particles mattered while drinking it.  You could just see small pieces that didn't completely dissolve at the bottom of your cup/bottle of water.<br /><br />The small packets are easy to use, just tear the corner and add to water.  No problems with ease of use!"}
