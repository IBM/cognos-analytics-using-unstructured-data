The single pack is perfect to fill a water bottle with delicious flavor. It is easy to use too! All you have to do is tear the easy-to-tear packet and pour it in. The bag is small enough to allow you to pour the package's contents easily into the bottle without spilling it. I highly recommend this delicious beverage."}
