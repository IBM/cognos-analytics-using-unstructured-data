Everything from soda, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and flavored water, so we always enjoy giving new beverages a try.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix is a blend of tea, honey and strawberry acai that comes in a 10-Count box with each powdered package producing a 16 ounce drink.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Easy to make, just add water, stir/shake and you're done.<br /><br />+ Convenient for travel.<br /><br />+ Good way to add flavor to water.<br /><br />+ 5 calories per 8 ounce serving.  One packet makes a 16 ounce serving.<br /><br />+ No aspartame.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Contains sucralose.<br /><br />- Doesn't really taste like tea.  Tasted more like strawberry Kool-Aid or Jell-O to me.<br /><br />- May be a bit too sweet for some.<br /><br />Powdered \"On-The-Go\" drink mixes always seem to be hit or miss in our house.  Most of the time they taste terribly artificial or too tart/sweet for our tastes.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix was no exception.  It tasted very little like any flavored tea I've ever tried.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for a sweet and refreshing drink.  However, I think many people will have difficulty equating the flavor of this drink mix with tea."}
