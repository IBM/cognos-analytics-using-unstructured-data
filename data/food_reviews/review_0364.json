Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box."}
