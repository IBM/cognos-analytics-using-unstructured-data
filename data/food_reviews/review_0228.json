It is indeed a Fog Chaser.  Once or twice a week I get interested in a couple of cups of this delightful French Roast.  Amazon.com sent me an e-mail and I thought it would be fun to give it a try.  It's strong and delightful!!!!  As a senior, I find it's exciting to try new things.  And, some turn out to be winners."}
