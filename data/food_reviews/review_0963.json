Considering it's price it's about to become a staple.  Cyclone and the French Roast are pretty good dark brews also.  I'm unqualified to comment on the lighter roasts.<br /><br />What I like most is the company.  I wrote a review on k-cups I didn't even purchase and Brooklyn reached out to me in an attempt to make it up to me; as if I was an actual customer, not a lot of companies would do that.  They sent me a sampler pack.  I'm very impressed with both Fuhgeddaboutit and the company. So today I go to Amazon to purchase a box and they are sold out.  What a cruel twist."}
