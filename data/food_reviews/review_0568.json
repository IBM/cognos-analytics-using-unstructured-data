Just great when you only want one cup, and a generous sized cup at that.  I've used a half-packet for a small cup. It's very rich and flavorful, there is not another instant like this.  My husband drinks strictly decaf, and it's usually a Starbucks Via Italian Roast.  During our recent relocation, living in a furnished apartment with an inferior coffee maker, we both used VIA for the duration.  The Amazon price is lowest I've found, but I'd pay full-price if necessary, it's worth it."}
