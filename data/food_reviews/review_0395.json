I'm a bargain hunter and have considered going back to my drip coffee due to the rising prices of K cups.I read all the reviews,and feeling there was nothing to lose I debated between French Roast and Fog Chaser. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser did not disappoint (haven't tried the French Roast yet). Fog Chaser is a moderatly bold coffee, smooth, with no hint of bitterness. As for the skeptics concerned with the \"netted\" base of the cup affecting taste and freshness...the product is packaged in mini packs ( sealed thick plastic) of 8 cups to protect freshness. In addition, I feel the netting (not flimsy by any means) offers a better fitration system that the typical K cup. I only write reviews about products that excite me, or repulse me. Obviously, I am a San Francisco Bay Coffee fan. If you choose to try this product, I'm pretty sure you will be pleasantly surprised."}
