I don't drink coffee but love, love gadgets.  So order to enjoy my new GADGET I had to find something to make.  I found Grove Square Cappuccino by accident.  I add some whipped cream on the top and what I end up with is a heavenly dessert that has none of the bitter taste of coffee.  I also bought the French Vanilla version and decided I liked it so much that I am on a monthly plan.  For anyone who loves flavored drinks this is perfect.  And my hubby finally came around and uses the Keurig for his coffee.  He does not use this drink since it does not have a coffee taste, thank goodness.<br /><br />I have been watching negatives and positives.  It is all a matter of preference and taste.  I happen to love this coffee because it is sweet and does not taste like coffee.  I simply hate coffee and this is a way to enjoy the Keurig and share some time with my husband who does drink coffee.  As for the additives... welcome to this world of the 21st century!  It satifies my sweet tooth and keeps me from eating cake, cookies, pie and ice cream.  So Grove Square bring it on."}
