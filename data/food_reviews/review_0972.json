I was on vacation when it arrived so it took awhile for me to use the first one. I ordered the Donut Shop, a decaf and Fuhgeddaboudit. I will say the donut shop was a disappointment, but i LOVEEE fugeddaboudit. I normally use either starbucks or newman''s and the flavor is so rich with brooklyn bean. I just happened to stumble upon the review and I am surprised at the negative ones. ( at least for this flavor)"}
