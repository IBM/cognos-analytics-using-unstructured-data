That being said, I found this to be probably the best k-cup I have ever had.  It is very creamy and has a great hazelnut flavor.  I enjoy a cappucino once in a while and I love hazelnut coffee.  I expected this to be more of  cappucino with a light hazelnut flavor.  That was not the case.  This is like a creamy coffee/hazelnut flavored hot cocoa without the cocoa.  I was expecting something completely different but ended up being pleasantly surprised.  This is a great after dinner or mid day pick-me-up and this will now hold a permanent row or two in my revolving k-cup counter top display. If you want a real cappucino, this isn't for you.  If you want a great tasting hot liquid sweet snack, get this.  I liked this so much, I will be ordering the French vanilla version to give that a try as soon as I complete this review. Also, you cant beat the price....less than $10 delivered to my door.  Wooooo Hooooo!"}
