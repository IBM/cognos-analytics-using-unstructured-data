Personally, I think water tastes just fine the way it is, but since I'm also a tea drinker (in mass quantity) I thought I'd try this. It's OK, it's fine, I have no complaints about the taste, though it's a bit on the too sweet side. The taste is kind of familiar and I'm not really sure what it reminds me of, but it tastes a bit like a melted popsicle or like Jello. In fact, it tastes a lot like licking jello powder off of your fingers, come to think of it--which is to say that it's not a bad taste by any means, and kids will probably like it. Also, if like me you drink too much sugar, you might want to give this a try mixed with club soda or seltzer--I imagine it would be good that way. One packet only has five calories. Would I go out of my way to buy it? Probably not, but you never know :) I'm going to try making ice cubes from it next :)"}
