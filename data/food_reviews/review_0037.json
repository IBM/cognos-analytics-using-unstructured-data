It's real easy to make - you can drop the contents of each pouch in to either a bottle of water or two cups of water and you have ice tea. It dissolves fairly easily even in cold water. The ingredients include honey and sugar, citric acid, green tea, sucralose, maltodextrin, hibiscus extract and beta carotene. The mango and pineapple flavors are very subtle and do not influence the taste too much. It's great and refreshing on a summer afternoon."}
