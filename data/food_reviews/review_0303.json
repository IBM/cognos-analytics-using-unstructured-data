A persistent criticism of K-Cups in the press is the amount of plastic that winds up in the landfill.  We all know (and love) the ease of popping in a cup, pressing the brew button, and tossing the cup afterwards.  So easy!  However I've always felt guilty about the waste, as normally I compost coffee grounds and of course there is no plastic associated with a paper coffee filter.  You can buy refillable K-cups but none of them fit my B30 apparently and anyway the convenience factor diminishes greatly.  These work in my B30 perfectly.  It's hard for me to judge the taste - I add milk and sugar - but the bouquet is pleasing."}
