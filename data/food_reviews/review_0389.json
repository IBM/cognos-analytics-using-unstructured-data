And now I can honestly say I will never go back to the regular K-Cups again! I usually run a K-Cup through the largest setting and then through the smallest (my coffee cup is rather large :). This Fog Chaser coffee holds up rather well. I've gotten a great, bold cup of joe every morning since receiving these. There have been no problems with grounds in the cup as sometimes happens with regular K-Cups or the refillable K-Cups.<br /><br />The 80 count box came with a reusable storage container that holds a week of pods. It's just a flimsy, clear plastic container but it does keep the coffee fresh."}
