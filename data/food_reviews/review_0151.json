But it still has an artificial sweetener in it - sucralose. So instead of Satan, you are getting the Devil here ... and they also let this product sailing under a false flag, by putting \"Tea&Honey\" in BIG letters up front. So naturally, you might think that this is an actual healthy product, organic even. Just read the ingredients list and you will quickly recognize what it really is: sugared water with some flavors in it.<br />But, not deterred by that, I prepared a glass for a brave self-mutilating test - YIKES.<br />Artificial taste, very sweet, immediate scratching and itching in the back of my throat, chemical aftertaste, just totally and utterly horrible.<br />Blackberry/Pomegranate? Yeah, I guess if you know what the label claims it should taste like, you could actually imagine that for a second or two - there is a hint of that in this drink, but at a very faint level. It has some, well, mummified blackberries in it, too, but that is an almost comical detail.<br />And something else happened to me, which was already described by other reviewers - as soon as I opened the package, a very fine dust emitted which immediately made me cough and gasp for air. I just hope, this stuff is just bad tasting and not toxic on top of it ...<br />Very rarely, I bemoan the  fact that Amazon makes you give at least one star. For this product, I would like to have the opportunity to give no star at all ..."}
