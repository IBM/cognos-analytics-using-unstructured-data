This was just fine with me since I don't like my drink to be too sweet.  So I tend to just pour a half-packet's worth of contents into a glass filled with very cold water each time I want to use this product, then give the mix a good stir.<br /><br />The drink tastes sweet.  I can discern the tea but not the mango or pineapple.  There is a hint of honey, but the drink's sweetness is probably due to the sucralose, which is listed as the fourth ingredient.  I didn't discern an aftertaste.  Overall, I think it's a fine drink.  Nothing really special to get excited about."}
