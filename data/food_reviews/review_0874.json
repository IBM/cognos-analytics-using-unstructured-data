I usually look at feedback before purchasing. Today looking at the feedback I would not purchase this Brooklyn Bean Roastery Breakfast Blend Coffee. 2 out of the 1st 4 k-cups I used plugged the machine and NOTHING came out. Also it plugged the k-cup holder needle so the next k-cup of my good coffee was wasted also - nothing came out until I cleaned the needle. Soooooooooo it took 3 k-cups for me to finally get a cup of coffee. I am disappointed because the Brooklyn coffee had so many choices and reasonable prices that I was ready to buy more. NOT NOW......<br />J Fred Madden OHIO<br />Update<br />The Brooklyn sent me a complete replacement of my original order. So far I have tried 3 of the replaced k-cups and they worked like a champ. I believe there was a problem and Brooklyn solved and resolved it!! I will try some of their other flavors and hope they all will work as well<br />JFRED"}
