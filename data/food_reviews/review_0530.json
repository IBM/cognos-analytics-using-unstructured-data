Occasionally (not often) coffee inside turns into a solid but bendable flat stick inside the package so I would not say the date doesn't matter!  In one case, because it was expired, Starbucks wouldn't replace it and said they'd seen it before.  I love the coffee but beware that sometimes this does happen.  Not sure why, possibly pinhole in packaging?<br /><br />update 10/16/2-12  video showing another \"chewing gum stick consistency\" Via found in not yet expired date.  I'd open it to show but then I couldn't return."}
