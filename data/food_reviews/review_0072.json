This mango pineapple has a great taste, not too sweet. It has a slightly tropical taste but is not overpowering, even when mixed with a smaller bottle of water than what the directions specify. I took a couple of sips to allow shaking room, then add the powder. The packet is easy to open without spills, yet sturdy enough not to tear open in a handbag or pocket. It does take quite a bit of shaking to completely dissolve the powder, but nothing too difficult.<br />I will buy more of these. They sure help with my water intake without adding too many extra calories."}
