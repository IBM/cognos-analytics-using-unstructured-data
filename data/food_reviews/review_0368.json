The first time we ordered it, I LOVED it. We are avid coffee drinkers in my house, and both love a nice bold coffee. Since the price was right and we liked the coffee, we ordered again. The 2nd shipment we received was still \"good\" coffee, but it wasn't as great as the first. My husband says he couldn't tell much difference, but the 2nd shipment did not have the same smooth finish and mouth-watering aroma as the original. That being said, it did not stop us from drinking it all, but I do have to wonder which is the abnormality! I rated this at a 4 since we were so impressed by the first shipment, and I really like the way the OneCup brews. As other reviewers mentioned, there is a \"crema\" produced by the OneCup that you rarely see with a K-Cup, which is NICE! I like the less packaging, and don't mind the occasional sediment in my cup (when we brew coffee, we generally do French Press, so we can handle that!). If I had the option of rating 3.5 I would have, since the quality of the 2nd shipment would definitely rank a 3 most likely. I do think we will try this again and see if \"the third time is the charm\". I will try to remember to update on what we think so that we can provide some feedback as far as consistency goes.<br />Thanks for reading!"}
