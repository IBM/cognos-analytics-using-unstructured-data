Great price. Get a ziploc & enjoy","text":"I like strong coffee and this coffee taste very good even when brewed on the big/travel mug setting. It's flavorful, not burnt tasting, and has a good kick. And to me represents a standout value in the world of Keurig choices. Do the math, especially with Subscribe and Save. I know some folks complain about them losing freshness... I just transfer them to a ziplock bag upon opening the package. Not a big deal and I don't sense I've lost freshness.<br /><br />I'd dock them half a star for the bag-to-bag transfer  (here's an idea: package them with a zipper, like cold cuts!) but it still rounds up to 5 stars. :-)"}
