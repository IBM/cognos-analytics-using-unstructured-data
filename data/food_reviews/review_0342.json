Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning."}
