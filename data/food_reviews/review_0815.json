However, more often than not, I wind up with coffee grounds in my cup. Sometimes there are so many grounds I have to dump the whole cup. I don't have this problem with other types of K-cups I use, so I wonder if this grind is too fine to use in K-cups.Otherwise, this would be a nice cup of morning coffee."}
