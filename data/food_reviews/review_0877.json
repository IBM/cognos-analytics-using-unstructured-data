I ordered the Cyclone and the Fuhgeddaboutit.  Both are great.  The Cyclone has a smoother taste, while the Fuhgeddaboutit is truly bold - which I like.<br />Thankfully, I have not had any of the issues that others have posted.  I was surprised to read about all the problems.  I feel like I received the same shipping lot - the first orders, so I am pleased that I have not had any explode or fall apart in my machine.  After reading about the issues, I was curious about the k-cups, so I compared them to the k-cups of Wolfgang Puck and Cafe Escapes (all I had on hand)and noticed that the diameter of the Brooklyn cups are a little larger than the other two brands - not sure if that is a problem or not. I ordered the box of 36 cups for each flavor and will be ordering again."}
