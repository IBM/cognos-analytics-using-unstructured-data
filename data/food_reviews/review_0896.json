I've experienced  > 50% failure rate - not much worse feeling in your mouth than a bunch of grounds.  tried 5 or 6 pods, only had 2 that didn't fail.  Anyone want to buy some leaky pods, cheap ?  Very disappointing, terrible quality control.<br /><br />Quality / taste of coffee itself was OK, if filters in pods had not failed this would of been a 3-star review."}
