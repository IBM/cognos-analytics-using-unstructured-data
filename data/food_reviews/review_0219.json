I tried it because it is a little cheaper, but still convenient, with the rising cost of coffee (and everything else) compared to grinding yourself and using the ekcobrew (which works much better than the standard k-cup self grind accessory, but is still a bit of a hassle with clean up).  We do vacuum seal a canister with these once we open the plastic bag (the order came with 3 bags of 12 pods), to keep the coffee fresh (since they can't have the oxygen purged like a normal k-cup for freshness).  Overall a nice strong cup that is smooth, with less hassle than self grind and fairly cheap (even cheaper with subscribe and save)"}
