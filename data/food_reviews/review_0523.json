Personally, I start out with a pot of fresh ground extra bold coffee in the morning.  It usually lasts me until around 3 in the afternoon, at which point I switch to using my VIAs.  They taste the most like fresh brewed coffee from any instant I've ever tried.  I also use the VIAs when I'm working late at night, heading out early for a meeting, or for Church on Sundays so I can avoid the \"burner coffee\".  ;)<br /><br />Being able to by them in bulk at $0.70 per packet makes this habit much more economical!  A big thanks to Starbucks for offering them through Amazon as well as their own store.  Finally, I received my pack of 50 on May 2nd, and it has an expiration date of October, if that helps any of you who are concerned about the expiration date problems described by others.  Perhaps it was just a backlog of product as people were discovering VIA available on Amazon?"}
