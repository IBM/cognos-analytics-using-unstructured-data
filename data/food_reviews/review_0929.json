Here's the thing, even if they do work properly the coffee is absolutely horrible!! I'd rather drink Folgers or Tasters Choice!! Seriously, I will never buy another product from these people again. They ought to be ashamed that they<br />even put that stuff in a K Cup. I can't believe they tried to put themselves in the same category as Tulleys or Barista Prima. I truly expected more from Brooklyn Beanery. I guess it's true what they say, you get what you pay for. I tried the \"Fuhgeddaboudit\" and all i want to do is forget about it!!! The \"Cyclone\" is even worse!!!!"}
