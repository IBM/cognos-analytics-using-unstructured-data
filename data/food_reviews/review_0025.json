Sucralose is approximately 600 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar), twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3 times as sweet as aspartame.<br /><br />On the front package it says:<br />Tea & Honey<br />Iced Green Tea: Blackberry Pomegranate Flavor with other Natural Flavor<br /><br />Back of package:<br />Liption Tea & Honey is a low calorie iced tea mix you can feel good about simply because it is made with real ingredients<br />- sweetened with honey<br />- made from real tea leaves<br />- real fruit flavors<br />with 5 calories per 8 fl oz serving and no aspartame - you know it taste good!<br /><br />This product is being falsely advertised as all natural when Aspartame has the same problems as sucralose!<br /><br />You can NOT taste the tea, you can sorta taste the honey as a base. It taste just like Splenda. I was very disappointment because it did not taste like tea, but red juice made with splenda."}
