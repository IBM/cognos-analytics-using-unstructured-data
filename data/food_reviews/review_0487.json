A few years ago, my daughter bought me a Keurig Coffeemaker for a holiday gift.  I gave it back to her because the Starbucks coffee is so superior & so easy, not to mention inexpensive.  Actually, when you purchase the Starbucks VIA from the internet it costs about 53 cents for 1 cup of coffee.  Which is more than 30 cents less than buying it at Starbucks itself.  The coffee is AMAZINGLY delicious.  The delivery is outstanding as well."}
