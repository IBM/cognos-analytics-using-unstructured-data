I actually forgot what fresh, real coffee tastes like.  At first I was taking back but the strong, robust flavor.  Then after a few sniffs and sips I felt rejuvenated.  For the first time since I got my Keurig I realized that I missed fresh brewed coffee.  The taste is so fresh, so lively, so good.  The price is also an added bonus.  This Crazy Coffee Mom is really hooked."}
