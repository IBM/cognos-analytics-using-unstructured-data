I've tasted better, but seeing as it's not made by a barista and only takes 5 seconds to produce, I'd say it's not bad. I was able to drink the whole cup, and that's good enough for me. However, if the fake sugar makes you sick, I'd stay away from this. Let's just say it's not organic or homemade, which it's not claiming to be."}
