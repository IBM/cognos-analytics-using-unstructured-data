Love the taste of the coffee but as with other reviewers some of them what I will call exploded in the brewer.  This left quite a mess to clean up. Even though this happened will order another flavor of this coffee as I love the coffee.<br />I will amend my review after receiving a box of the Cyclone Blend.  I have brewed 12-15 cups without any problems at all.  The company has apparently solved the problem they were having  with the k cups. As I stated previously I love the coffee.  After trying the Cyclone blend I've decided that this is the blend for me.  Will continue to purchase the coffee not only for the flavor but also the cost."}
