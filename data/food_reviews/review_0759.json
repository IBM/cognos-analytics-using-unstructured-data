Disappointed and upset are only two words that I can use to describe the experience. It was extremely sweet and already lightened (very light) and what I consider an instant coffee !! No where did it say that it is instant or artificially lightened. I called the company and they said it did not have to be labeled \"instant\" coffee. I don't think he even wanted to listen to me. I told him that I probably would not buy another of their products, especially after reading other reviews......and I would forwarn people about the product!"}
