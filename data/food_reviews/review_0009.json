While I'm not a big fan of green tea flavoring, I do enjoy the tastes of honey, blackberries, and pomegranates.  While that combination of flavors sounds interesting, I really did not enjoy the final result. I think my taste buds were a bit confused.  It might be nice to try this if you love all the flavorings listed, but I will stick to the more basic flavors."}
