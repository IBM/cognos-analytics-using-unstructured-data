However the overwhelming commentary from my household and those we shared this with, was it tasted off, like coffee mixed with dirt.<br /><br />I can usually forgive a bad cup of coffee once in a while and will even drink two day old microwaved coffee if I have to and not complain, but I am sorry, this was not good coffee.<br /><br />We did not buy based on price, but on the expectation we would get a solid cup of coffee for our 4 AM jolt of life.<br /><br />Now it could have been the batch or any other reason, I wont piss on the whole product line, however, but the coffee we recieved kinda blew."}
