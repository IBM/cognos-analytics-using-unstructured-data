A lot of the k-cups have been very weak and flavorless.  I have nearly finished my first order of the Fog Chaser and it is one of the better coffees I've had for the Keurig.  The k-cups are little different than the traditional plastic cups, but who cares?  And I can't figure out what \"smell\" other reviewers are talking about.  When you open a bag, it smells like ground COFFEE.  Uh, that is not a bad thing.  It is because the cups are made of a breathable filter pouch.  What does a box of regular K-cups smell like?  Plastic cups?<br />Each twelve comes in its own sealed plastic bag so I am not worried about them going stale unless it takes you a couple months to drink 12 cups.  And the price is much lower than most of the of the other brands.  I can't see spending 1 1/2 to 2 times as much for coffee that is either not as good or at best just as good.  I singed up for the subscribe and save to get it delivered regularly so I dont run out.  I just hope others find it as great tasting as I do so amazon keeps carrying it!"}
