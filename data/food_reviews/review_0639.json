It is exactly what I was looking for to make in my Keurig.  You see, I am NOT a coffee drinker so I am always on the look out for tea or other speacialty drinks to make in my Keurig.  This would be similar to the Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha and Chai Latte.  It is a mix that fully emties when you run it through the Keuirg.  A word of warning to the die hard coffee drinkers...this is not your Starbucks cappuccino.  It's more like your gas station cappuccino, which was exactly what I was looking for.  Great taste even on the largest cup setting on the Keurig platinum.  My new favorite morning pleasure."}
