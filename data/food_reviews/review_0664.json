The description says it is mildly sweet but I found it overwhelmingly sweet. There was little to no coffee taste, more like Cremora or Coffee Mate with fake sugar. I tried brewing one k cup of this coffee and then in the same cup added another k cup which was regular coffee in hopes of diluting the sweetness but even that way, it was still very sweet and whatever creamer they used was the dominant flavor by far.<br /><br />If you take a lot of cream and sugar in your coffee, you might like this coffee. I didn't like it at all."}
