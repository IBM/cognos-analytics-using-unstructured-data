It was fruity and a bit tart.  It doesn't really taste like \"iced tea\".  I know the green tea flavor is more mild, so if you are looking for an iced tea tasting beverage this isn't it.<br /><br />The serving size is half a packet to 8 ounces of water, so really what you are looking at is one packet to a normal sized water bottle (16.9 ounces) which puts it at 10 calories vs. 5.<br /><br />The product boasts \"No aspartame\" but it does contain sucralose, so it still has that artificial sweetner taste.  That doesn't bother me at all, I'm used to it.<br /><br />I found it dissolved quickly in the water and I wasn't dealing with undiluted chunks.<br /><br />This won't become my new beverage of choice or anything, but it's tasty and easy."}
