A great daily coffee. Be aware that the entire cup is not plastic, but the bottom portion is almost filter material. This might affect how long you keep the cups before using. The cups are vacuum sealed into a larger plastic bag, so that should help with freshness...<br /><br />The cost is on the low end for k-cups and makes this coffee even more inviting!!!  I definitely recommend as a staple daily coffee.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"}
