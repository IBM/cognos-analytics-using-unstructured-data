It's really tasty and I'm happy it dissolves easily, has vitamins, zero calories, is sugar free and is so convenient.  I keep these on hand at work to spruce up a plain bottle of water when I want some flavor.  These stix are really convenient to travel with too.  I can get a bottle of water anywhere and add the tea for a kick."}
