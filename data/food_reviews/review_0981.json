Great start to a sample pack and of course I had to dive right in and start testing the different flavors. Every single one I have tried except the french roast (not my style) was great. They all had full body flavor and a great taste. The only downfall I would say is that I ending up getting coffee grounds in most the cups which is why I only gave 4 stars but if that was fixed it would be a 5 star product. As someone else mentioned that they seem to brew slower than normal, it was a great experience (minus the grinds). Thank you Brooklyn Roasters!"}
