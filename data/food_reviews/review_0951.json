When I got the package, it was like Christmas - I tore open the box and made my 1st cup.  I really enjoyed the coffee.  Great flavor...  NOW...  jump forward to today... I wasted 4 pods and was unable to produce a cup.  The pod would fill with water, I could hear the machine trying to brew and nothing... actually water would trickle but it was full of grinds...  I was unable to produce a cup of coffee this morning - what gives; I was under the impression the issues were corrected?!?!?  Went back to my Coffee People Donut Shop and brewed without issue first try.  Now when I get home from work, I will need to spend time cleaning the Keurig since the Brooklyn pods made a mess all over my machine.<br /><br />On a side note, the cups that I was able to brew were very good..<br /><br />I am updating this as they send me a new box; no issues.  I am perfectly content with the coffee.."}
