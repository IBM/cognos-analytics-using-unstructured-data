They put instant coffee in a k-cup and pass it off as real brewed coffee.  I purchased their Dark roast to try it out.<br />The first thing I noticed was how lite the k-cup felt.  If you shake it, it sounds like a little snarl drum.  As it brews, you get a real dark thick mixture of water and coffee, and then only water.  When it was done I opened the k-cup.  No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good. (that's my personal opinion on the taste)  Overall:  You're getting low quality instant coffee at fresh brewed prices.  Shame on Grove Square."}
