I have tried just about every K-cup brand.  This is not packaged in the typical K-cup plastic cups.  It comes in bulk (12 per bag) and the One Cups have the same top as the K-cup but insead of the plastic housing it is a filter material.  This might bother some people.  I store them in a plastic zip lock so they will stay fresh.  The filtering process through a filter rather than the plastic housing might be what makes it taste so good or it may just be the coffee.  It is much less expensive at $13.59 per 36 than the typical K-cups as well as being the best tasting coffee.  I love the French Roast."}
