You just add them to a nice bottle of water, and you're set!  It's convenient and easy!  Well, that's what we have here - yet another contender in the powdered drink mix market.  In terms of being a powdered drink mix, it's okay. The packets open easily enough.  The only think I've noticed is that it takes longer to dissolve than some other ones I've tried in the past, but not excessively so.  It's also fairly low calorie, which is nice.  I'm sure you're all wondering, though, \"is it any good?\"<br /><br />Well, at the end of the day, it all comes down to taste.  This is where it goes wrong.  It's got a slightly unpleasant undertone of bitterness and sourness to it that I didn't like.  I mean, it's not the most foul thing I've ever drank, but it's not the best either.  It sort of tastes like fake strawberries and fake honey, which is strange because it claims to be made with \"real ingredients\".  Oh, and even though it's supposedly sweetened with honey, it has added sucralose to it.  Go figure.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm starting to wonder if tea is something that was just meant to be brewed like normal instead of condensed down into a dissolvable powder.  In fact, the best \"to go\" packet drinks I've had were blatantly fake, but at least they tasted good.  So, do I recommend this drink powder?  Well, if you want a convenient drink powder, then I'd try some other brand.  Although you might like the taste better than I did, so I guess you'll just have to try it yourself!  If you just want tea, then you might be better off just making a big batch of tea and pouring it into some bottles."}
