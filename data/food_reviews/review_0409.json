However there are times when the real thing just doesn't work, and at those times Via gets just enough things right to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I'll start out with the negatives. Both varieties remind of drinking from a pot of 'yesterdays' coffee. The kind where you can't finish the pot of coffee and rather than toss it all out, you let it sit and cool overnight and then reheat it the next morning. The next day the coffee is always more bitter and the flavor is flat as compared to a fresh brewed cup. Adding milk or cream helps, but the underlying flavor is still a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Though the worst part about the Via brand is the after-taste. There's something off about it. I don't know quite how to describe it. Almost like a tinge of paper/cardboard taste to it which is a bummer. I find I drink a cup of Via faster than a normal cup of coffee in order to combat that after-taste.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think I'm still likely to continue buying the Via brand. I understand this is instant coffee. I mean I'm tearing open a little pouch (love the design), dropping in some hot water, and I've got coffee. Just like that. That's pretty great. That ease of use, and fairly reasonable pricing means that in circumstances in which convenience trumps quality I can find a place for Via. Camping, too lazy to drive to a coffee shop, otherwise stuck drinking Folgers, quick pick-me-up during a zombie invasion, etc... are a few examples of when a packet of Via could come in handy."}
