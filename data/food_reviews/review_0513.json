AMAZON MAKES THESE AFFORDABLE. I am so excited they started selling them and are PRIME items!!! I could make back the money on my Prime membership on these alone.  At the time of this writing 66 cents for one packet! A little bit more than a k-cup (.43) but i dont have to carry around a machine in my purse to enjoy it.<br /><br />2. They are super convenient for camping / backpacking.<br /><br />3. I throw some in the car - so if I am traveling, I can stop at a gas station with hot water, instead of plunking down $4 on crap coffee.<br /><br />4. They do NOT taste like instant coffee. They taste delicious! And strong!<br /><br />5. Easy to open.<br /><br />6. Throw them in your purse when you need a coffee fix and your clients, friends, family dont like strong or good coffee.<br /><br />7. You don't have to clean a coffeepot or throw away a more bulky kcup."}
