I have a problem with grounds coming out of the top while brewing and clogging my Kuerig coffee maker. It is a pain getting all of the grounds out of the brewing area. I have only used 6 of the k-cups and 4 out of the 6 have been defective. I would not recommend them at all. The coffee itself tasted good with the 2 that I actually had work, but it is not worth the hassle of cleaning up a mess trying to use them. I have requested a refund from amazon and hoping I hear back from them within the next day.<br /><br />-----UPDATE-----<br /><br />Brooklyn Bean Roastery has a great customer service department!! They sent me a replacement box of an assortment of their different k-cups and I am pleased to say I am very happy. I have tried many different ones in the box and they have all worked great and taste good also. There were no decafs in the box, so I can not comment of how they are working now. Although, I have heard the exploding problem has been taken care of. So, I would recommend this company now. Also, Amazon's customer service is great too. They refunded my money for the bad box of decaf."}
