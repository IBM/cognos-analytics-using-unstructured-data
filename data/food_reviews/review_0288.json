The only problem I have with it is it comes in a fiber womb, not plastic like most other K-Cups. And sometimes it allows the coffee sediment to leak through. It doesn't happen all the time, found to be about 20-25% of the time. Also you have to place cups in a zip lock baggie to keep fresh, after you open Mfg's.bag. If it weren't for this I would have given it 5 Stars."}
