Really?","text":"What I expected: Something that tasted like green tea with perhaps a hit of honey, strawberry, and acai flavor, finished with the typical sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />What I got: A pleasant tasting strawberry soft drink with very little sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the taste of this drink is quite nice. The strawberry flavor is quite fresh-tasting and at room temperature is very fragrant. It's just not at all what I'd expect for a product from Lipton calling itself \"Green Tea Mix\". The powder dissolves very quickly, even when stirred with a spoon in an open glass (vs shaken in a bottle).<br /><br />So why only three stars? Like I said, I expected green tea. I got strawberry drink. If you're looking for strawberry, this is very good. If you're looking for tea, move along."}
