Non bitter, smooth bold medium-dark roast.  It is one of my personal favorites.  But the purchaser should be aware of how this coffee is packaged. It works great in the Keurig machines but the packaging is not a true K-cup.  A K-cup, as designed (and probably patented), is a small plastic cup sealed with a foil lid, under which is a coffee filter pouch of a single serving of coffee.  The packaging on this does not have the plastic cup encasing the foil lid and filter paper pouch of coffee.  I suspect the manufacturer is saving in paying licensing fees from using the K-Cup design by excluding the cup.  But you have to use different storage containers for these packages, as using the usual racks and other means of storing K-Cups will allow air to get to the coffee and cause it to go stale unless stored in an air-tight container or plastic bag.  Also, this packaging may not work in Keurig brewers that automatically dispose of the spent K-Cups.  Another slight inconvenience is that the brewed package leaves a wet coffee filter sack of coffee grounds, whereas with a genuine K-Cup, the spent package only has one small hole in the bottom of the plastic cup, the rest of the package is dry upon disposal handling."}
