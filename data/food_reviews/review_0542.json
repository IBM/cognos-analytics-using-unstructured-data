Although I think Starbucks coffee is just so-so unless buried beneath lots of caramel and other stuff, I really like these VIA instants for some reason.  Maybe it has more a french press taste and experience than other instants that draws me to them, I don't know.  I do know that I will take these quick and easy to use instant packs over the cafeteria coffee any day.  Before folks get all on me about my contradictions, it's a personal taste thing.  I love apples, too, and eat tons of them, but hate applesauce.  The same goes with these things...I hate liking them, but I do."}
