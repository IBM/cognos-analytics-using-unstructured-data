Man, it's delicious. It's as good as those French Vanilla cappuccinos you might get from a gas station in the middle of the night when driving down I-5, but you can get it in your own kitchen.<br /><br />Does it have much coffee in there? It's hard to say. The box claims that there is some instant coffee inside, but it certainly doesn't taste like it. It simply tastes like sweet delicious vanilla."}
