Yes, the coffee smells burned prior to use but I believe thatunless you are a  connoisseur of coffee I believe most might smelled \"burnt\".  Good coffee for the price and the \"K-Cup\" new packaging works just as well as the original stle K-Cup packaging. I believe I will try another brand for taste but would stay with SFbay if the price were 5 cents less per cup.  I drink alot of coffee.!!"}
