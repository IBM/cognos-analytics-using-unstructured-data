I liken it more to Dunkin coffee than Starbucks.  The pods work fine even though as others have pointed out, they are not true K Cups.  They come in 3 x 12-pod bags, and they stay fresh until you open the bag.  You can reseal the bag with tape, or transfer the pods to a ziplock bag.  I happened to have an OXO coffee storing container that keeps them fresh after they are taken out of their plastic bag.<br /><br />Give 'em a try, they're not half bad, and it sure beats paying $15 for 24 K Cups."}
