The coffee tastes great but since the 'cups' don't have the plastic bottoms (a filter element), we had to store in a sealed jar to keep them fresh and not have the coffee bean smell thru-out the house.  (or you could use a plastic ziploc - original bag was not re-sealable).  They did one thing finally right - you don't have to pay MORE for going green when buying LESS packaging.  Kudos."}
