Grounds were everywhere inside the Keurig holder, and the Keurig no longer made coffee since the little hole was clogged.  We blamed the coffee maker and cleaned it out.  It worked fine until we tried another Booklyn decaf k-cup.  Again grounds were all over the holder, the k-cup was full of water, and the coffee maker was clogged.  There is something seriously wrong with the packaging of Brooklyn k-cups.  I see Amazon won't take them back so I may try to open them all and use them in our drip coffee maker."}
