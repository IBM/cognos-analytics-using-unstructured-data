When the order arrived the shipping and all packaging was perfect with no damage to any part of the order. When we began to brew the individual K-cups in our Keurig brewer there was a problem with grounds in the coffee and the brewer had a tendency to clog up using the Brooklyn Bean Roastery brand K-cup. The individual K-cups all seemed to be a normal size with no apparent damage. We have owned our Keurig brewer for several years and tried a large amount of other brands and coffee types without any problem. I'm not sure if this was a bad box or bad batch of the product, but we continue to use our brewer on all other brands with no problems."}
