The SF Bay Fogchaser was none of the above. I like the \"cup\" it's a lot less packaging than the normal k-cup (which isn't accepted in our recycling can). With these, I recycle the top and plastic ring and throw the rest into the compost pile. Yes, they look funny, and yes you need to put them into some sort of airtight container to keep them fresh, but a small change for a pretty good cup o' joe."}
