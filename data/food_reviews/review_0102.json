This product (as a couple other reviewers have stated) has sucralose in it. If I drink or eat products with sucralose in them, I get migraines. So I can't even taste it to tell you how it tastes.<br /><br />When a product description says \"naturally sweetened with honey\" And the second ingredient IS honey, WHY why why why throw in an artificial sweetner? That's like adding peach flavour to a slice of peach. Why make something that IS healthy, unhealthy and more expensive to produce by adding unnecessary ingredients?<br /><br />Depending on how you feel about Stevia, try the True Orange/True Lemon products...or enjoy your plain water :-) That's the way I'm going to go."}
