This new iced tea by Lipton is just okay it is not really what I would call my preferred tea. I'm not sure if it is the honey or the strawberry but it has a funny aftertaste in my mouth. It definitely is a required taste that would take time to get used to, after one has acquired this case it might be very tasty, however I'm not much for a sweet tea. I have drank raspberry iced teas and have liked them but they to are an acquired taste. If you like flavored iced tea this is the tea for you!<br /><br />Try this iced tea at your own risk."}
