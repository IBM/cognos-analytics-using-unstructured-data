Don't get me wrong.... I like water when I'm hot and thirsty, but to just drink all those glasses of water each day (as recommended) gets pretty boring to me.<br /><br />I do love iced tea, but again there's that whole brewing thing, and the instant has a strange after taste.<br /><br />Not with this Lipton Great Tea mix!.<br /><br />Easy to use, just tear off the top and pour.  You can stir it in a glass, or just dump it into your water bottle and shake.<br /><br />It mixes easily, dare I say you can take it with you and use it in restaurant water rather than ordering a soft drink?<br /><br />But it tastes great!  NO after taste!!<br /><br />I plan to purchase more of this product.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF"}
