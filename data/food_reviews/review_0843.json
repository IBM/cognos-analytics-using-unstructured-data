I just got my new Box and the seals problem is gone, the coffee is lovely, strong BROOKLYN STYLE ... with a low acidity that makes for a relaxing GOURMET cuppa Joe...Fuhgeddaboudit! Thans to BBR for being a terrific Amazon supplier! :-)<br /><br />Well, I pre-ordered this terrific K-Cup, and had some problems with initial run of seals, and strength. Happily the folks at Brooklyn Bean will send me a FREE new box ... and btw you get 36 ct. boxes here not 24!<br /><br />The coffee is smooth, strong and bold...a real \"Brooklyn\" cup of Joe...and it is very reminiscent of Emeril's Big Easy, only stronger and smoother, much smoother<br /><br />Nice chocolate overtones to my palate.<br /><br />So drink up Brooklyn and Fuhgeddaboudit!"}
