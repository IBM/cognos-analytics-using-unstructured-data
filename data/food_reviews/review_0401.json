Could be a smoother coffee","text":"These k cups are great for being green!  I love less plastic and don't get grounds in my cup. That being said the coffee is pretty good.  It's hard to find a really strong K cup coffee that's not burnt or harsh tasting.  This one is pretty close to being smooth.  I wish Amazon would offer B***sta kcups on auto delivery!"}
