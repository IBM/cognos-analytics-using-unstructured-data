The coffee tastes like \"organic\" grown beans. I stopped buying Kcups because I just wasn't getting the caffeine kick that I demand from my coffee. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser coffee is the only Kcup coffee I have ever purchased that actually tastes like strong black coffee as opposed to the usual Kcup brew of hot colored water.<br /><br />I will definitely keep my \"Subscribe and Save\" order for SFB Fog Chaser coffee."}
