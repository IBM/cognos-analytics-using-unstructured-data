Rich, flavorful, bold, and very tasty.<br /><br />I was put off by the odd look of the cup at first...as many others have described, it looks strange when you first see it.  If you turn it upside down it looks like a cranium in a hair net.  But it's just as easy to use as a typical k-cup, so no problem there.  The only problem you might have is trying to place it in one of those vertical k-cup dispensers you can get wherever you buy k-cups.  This cup doesn't sit well in there.<br /><br />One thing you'll notice when you open the cardboard box and cut open the rather thick plastic pouch the 12 containers come in: the smell.  It's extremely rich, a very deep, bold smell that makes you think of your very best cup of coffee ever.  Think about it, though: that's the smell of your coffee when it's manufactured and placed within the container.  I doubt the plastic k-cups are as bold when they're tapped into by the Keurig machine...I'm sure they've disseminated some of the freshness on their way to you.<br /><br />What I do to keep that flavor is to take each cup out of the nice thick bag and immediately re-seal the bag with a strong clip.  I feel that retains the flavor.  In that sense, I'm glad they don't fit on the vertical k-cup dispensers...I like that the freshness stays intact within the thick plastic bag.<br /><br />Anyway, I love this flavor.  Keep it secure in the plastic pouch and you'll have a great fresh taste every time you want a cup."}
