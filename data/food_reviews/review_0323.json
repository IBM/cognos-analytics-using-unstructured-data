I love it! It's a good strong brew, with a nice smoky aroma. The 36-count comes as 3 plastic bags of 12 cups. After opening the 1st bag, I'm keeping the remainder in the bag, sealed with a clip. It's possible that these could have freshness issues if left out for several days/weeks. I don't think my supply will last long enough to go bad though. I like the idea of less plastic - I like to compost my coffee grounds in the summer and these have much easier access to dumping out the grounds. (I can just tear open the mesh bag.) They fit in the Keurig and brew just fine.<br /><br />In fact, I usually buy the strongest coffee k-cups so I can \"double-brew\" mine into a bigger mug. True coffee aficionados may not prefer this. It may be too strong if you like lighter roasts or flavored coffees.<br /><br />Tastes great, cheaper and more environmentally friendly than other k-cups!"}
