I have purchased two different flavors. The first box arrived about a day after the coffee got released. There were about 10 k-cups that were damaged and coffee grounds were everywhere. To Amazon's credit they issued a refund. The second box was delivered with no damage to the k-cups. So I have brewed about 20 of the k-cups and around 50-60% of them are faulty. I never have had this issue with other brands. Either I get a ton of coffee grounds in my coffee or end the end of the brew cycle, when the machine blows air out it splatters coffee grounds all over my coffee cup, coffee maker or counter. I then have to discard that cup and brew another, such a waste.<br /><br />I do think the coffee is great and flavorful. I would purchase again if they would fix the issues with the k-cups. Until then I can not recommend anyone purchase this product."}
