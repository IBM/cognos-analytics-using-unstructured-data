I find myself drinking the hazelnut, then making this in the same cup with some of the hazelnut still in there, as well as just drinking it by itself.<br />After trying several cocoas and cappuccinos, I was skipping the kcups and just using the machine to make hot water and using the far cheaper instant cocoa packets.  But after a freind had me try the caramel cappuccino, I ordered boxes of my own, and I am still happy with the taste after a month of it."}
