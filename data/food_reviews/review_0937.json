We would have not have given any stars based upon the deceptive description of this product.<br />Should you prefer the taste of Starbucks' French Roast, this coffee pales in comparison. It does not have the \"Dark Roast\", \"Extra Bold\" taste of Starbucks' French Roast, and has somewhat of an instant coffee flavor taste. A couple of suggestions if you are looking for variety are Green Mountain's Dark Magic (even their decaf tastes good) and Coffee People's Black Tiger. Brooklyn Bean Roastery's Fuhgeddaboudit, you should Fuhgeddaboudit. They do not even provide a telephone number; only a form to fill in with your contact information.
