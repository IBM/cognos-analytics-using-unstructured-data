While the price is better, the quality is not. I found that I could only use the medium cup size on my machine or the coffee was too weak for my liking. This was not a problem with the Nantucket blend, so simply based on serving size, the savings go out the window.<br /><br />The flavor (for a medium size) is good and it compares favorably with Nantucket and some other blends I have tried. However, as a number of other reviewers have noted, the cup brews VERY slowly, and in fact, my machine stops about 50% of the time and pauses for up to a minute before the cycle resumes. Additionally, I get grounds in my cup about 50% of the time, from just a few to \"pour the cup out and try again\". Nothing explosive like one of your reviewers, thank goodness.<br /><br />Because of the inconsistency, it is, as I said, like going to Vegas. It was worth a try, but I will not buy this brand again."}
