I am a big fan of Amazon's Subscribe & Save program and have been getting my K-cups this way for over a year.  Of course, once you find one you absolutely love (Timothy's World Midnight Magic), poof!  The Magic's gone!  Midnight Magic is still available on Amazon, though no longer offered through Subscribe & Save, and I refuse to pay $35 for 48 K-cups of any brand.  S & S now offers SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser and based on the quantity of favorable reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  The pods are far different than what we've all been used to, but they work like a charm, have less waste, and deliver a pretty bold, smooth cup of coffee.  My morning coffee always consists of two pods at the 6 oz. setting each for one eye-opening 12 oz. mug of coffee.  On that setting, Fog Chaser lives up to its name.  I have noticed some residue occasionally, but it certainly is minimal.  The pods come packed in plastic bags (12 pods/bag).  Once cut open, I just fold over the edge, clip it and store the bag in the fridge.  Strength is a personal decision, and to me, more than 6 oz. of water with ANY pod is too weak.  If you are a fan of Rev of Jet Fuel, this coffee is comparable."}
