Just FYI though, the directions say to add one packet of mix per quart of water.  That's really more like half a pitcher.  BUT, that seemed like a high ratio to me, so I just used one packet in my 2 qt pitcher, and it was plenty sweet.  In fact, I really can't imagine wanting to add any more mix.  So, double the water/half the mix, and it'll be great."}
