It's a value, but don't fall for the okie doke....This is not a good cup of Joe.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Brooklyn-Bean-Roastery-FrenchRoast-36-Count/dp/B006Q822L0<br /><br />After writing my original review the Mfg contacted me and offered me samples. Let me just say they were polite and not even the slightest bit defensive. They just wanted to prove to me like they can brew a cup of coffee that didn't taste like dish soap! And guess what...The Colombian and Fuhgeddaboudit brands were good!<br /><br />Now the big question is...Would I buy this brand again? Absolutely! Integrity is hard to find and they have integrity."}
