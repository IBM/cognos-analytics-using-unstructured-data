These are a terrific low-guilt, more responsible alternative.<br /><br />Less storage space: they take up much less room to store.  I buy my k-cups in quantity to save money, but then I had to dedicate a large cabinet to storing them!  Not so with these, partially because they're less bulky and partially because...<br /><br />Great Price: these k-cups are much less expensive than other brands, especially at the Subscribe & Save price.  At this price, I can buy less at a time and still pay way less per cup than I could finagle with coupons & sales & bargain-shopping the major brands.<br /><br />Taste: Ok, obviously this is the most important factor...and so as soon as they arrived I threw one in and...hurray, they're tasty!  Fog Chaser is a slightly less strong taste than I usually drink, but I find it pleasant & smooth & complex in flavor.  It tastes like it smells, which is very nice.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm keeping my subscription.  How can you beat cheap, tasty, less bulky, and less waste?  You really can have it all.<br /><br />Update a month later: this roast has really grown on me!"}
