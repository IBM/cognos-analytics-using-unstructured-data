Having never heard of them but being a gourmet coffee lover, I was delighted to try them. The flavor of the cyclone is intense. So carmelly (is that a word?) and very rich. I loved it! Perfect with a light pastry in the morning.<br /><br />The breakfast blend was super good both hot and cold. I brewed a standard hot cup on my keurig and poured it over ice with a little creamer. It was absolutely delicious.<br /><br />I'm not quite done the pack but am definitely impressed! These aren't your typical bitter starbucks or overpriced Gloria Jeans. The best compairson I have found are the Emeril K-cups, and although being in the Delta I'm a fan of rich chicory coffee (the only thing I can find missing from the BBR selection) these are a better every day blend.<br /><br />Happy drinking! :)"}
