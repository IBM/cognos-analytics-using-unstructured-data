I do not think so!  States sweetened with Honey! On the box, under ingredients, it also has Sucralose in it!","text":"I feel very deceived by Lipton and the seller that they wrote that it is naturally sweetened by honey and when I received it, I noticed that it also has Sucralose in it.  Exactly what I was trying to get away from and avoid!  Artificial sweeteners!  Very unhappy with Lipton and this seller.  And yes, I can taste the artificial sweetener in it!  The drink is okay but nothing special.<br />******** I would rate the drink on a a scale of ten, about a 7.<br />******** But I rate the seller here a zero, for not disclosing that it contained artificial sweetener also."}
