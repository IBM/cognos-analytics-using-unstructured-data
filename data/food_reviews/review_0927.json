I thought it might be one of the kcups inside had broken and that was the case but it appeared that none of the kcups inside were damaged.  That being said the outside packaging looked promising, great design.  Overall I have been underwhelmed by the quality of the coffee.  It tastes old and weak.  Plus the Kcups look like they were hand done and don't have the uniformity I would expect from a professional Kcup manufacturer. I've ordered multiple different brews from the Brooklyn Bean Roastery so I'm hoping some of the next versions will be done with higher quality.  While it isn't my favorite coffee by any means it is drinkable and I'm going to try different size cups to see if I can get it to be a bit more bold and rich.<br /><br />-----UPDATE:<br />So I finally received the rest of my order Fuhgeddaboudit and Cyclone.  All of these have been less than average.  The kcup packaging is flawed in each case I received.  I also dislike all of the different coffee styles.  Each one tastes like the grounds are dry and stale.  Although I'd like to blame quality control I really think the coffee itself is just bad. Either way I will definitely not be buying coffee from this company again and I would warn everyone reading these reviews to stay away as well.  All their 5 star reviews are from people that don't have verified orders.<br /><br />I wasted my money... don't waste yours."}
