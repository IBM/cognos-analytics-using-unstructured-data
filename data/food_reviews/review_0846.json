It was suggested to be a substitute for Dark Magic coffee - to my taste, this it is not.  To get the flavor I want, I use 6 ounces max water when making this.  The construction of the kcups does not seem to be up to par.  Coffee grinds are found in the box and sometimes in the bottom of your cup.  The brewing flow sometimes backs up.  Nevertheless, I rated it a 3 because I really like this coffee after dinner.<br /><br />UPDATE June 14<br /><br />Received replacement kcups from Brooklyn Bridge as promised.  They work fine, brewing well, no grounds in coffee.  Because of better brewing?, coffee seems to raste better in this batch."}
