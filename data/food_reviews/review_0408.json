Cheaper than buying coffee at Starbuck's.","text":"This coffee tastes great.  Sometimes a cup of coffee in my office is so bad I just won't drink it.  I don't drink coffee often, so I keep a stash of the Via's around for when I actually do have a cup.  I like to enjoy my coffee when I drink it.<br /><br />The via packets are small.  You can put them in your pocket, purse, or even a wallet depending on the size of your wallet.  All you need is hot water and you will have a good cup of coffee.  They are great for camping too.<br /><br />My wife and I stopped using our french press to make coffee now that we have the 30 pack of Via's in the house."}
