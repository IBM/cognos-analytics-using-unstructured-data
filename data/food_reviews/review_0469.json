I love the product.  Unfortunately I received this 50ct order yesterday (October 19) and the expiration date is December 2010.  It says on the side of the box that it was produced in December 2009 with a one year expiration date.  I'll probably finish it by then, but I don't appreciate getting a 10 month old food product."}
