I wasn't sure if it was new to Amazon or a new product overall.  I've purchased a box and have another on it's way as I am very satisfied with the taste of the brew.  I am still on the first box that I've ordered.  I've owned my Keurig since December 2011 and have been through a large sum of K-Cups of various brands in my attempt to find my go-to-brand.  I was lookimg to contact the seller directly but since it's Amazon I was left to leave my comments here.  Now, as I've said the coffee tastes great, but not sure if it's a fluke thing as I've NEVER had this happen, but 2 of these K-Cups brewed grounds in the cup and I had another that was unable to have the hole puncture through it. I would say I am half way through a box of 36.  I will be sure to update if they problem happens again or never happens again...Anyone else experience this with any K-Cups?"}
