Definitely reminds you of KoolAid.  Its extremely sweet, but does have a tart pom feel to it.  But I have to admit, I like and and it gets me to drink more fluids.  I think you could ideally mix with 24 oz and not 16 oz as recommended on the package since its pretty sweet.  Has a lot of coloring but seems like natural color."}
