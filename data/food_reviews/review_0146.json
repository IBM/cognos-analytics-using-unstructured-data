I decided not to add the entire package all at once because I have read it is a bit too sweet. The first thing I noticed is the granules are pretty big, and it took a lot of shaking and even letting it sit a bit before it dissolved all the way.<br /><br />Right away I could smell a fruity but chemical like fragrance when I opened the bottle. The first sip it tasted watered down because I didn't use the whole package but at the same time it is overly sweet. Tastes like sugar water. I went ahead and put the whole package in, and it did darken the water to a nice burgundy color. With the whole package in it, it does give it more of a flavor and doesn't taste watered down, but it is still sweet. It has a weird after taste and I taste no honey at all. I do kind of taste the pomegranate but I don't really taste any tea or honey. Every morning I have hot lipton black tea and add honey. So, I know what tea with honey tastes like and this is not it.<br /><br />The weird after taste really gets to me. I don't know what it is but it distracts from the overall taste and makes me not want to really drink it. I don't know how to really describe it, almost a cardboard taste to it. It is funky."}
