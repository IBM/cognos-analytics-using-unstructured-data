To me there's two kinds of coffee, the smooth kind and the kind that has a bite.<br /><br />I feel like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts have a bite to them, something that makes them different. This Fog Chaser coffee is like that. There's something about it that makes it different and I think it's really good!<br /><br />The cups are not your normal K cup so I just got a metal tin and put them in there to keep them fresh.<br /><br />If you do the subscribe and save on amazon, it makes these cups very affordable (for k cups).<br /><br />Overall, very good coffee."}
