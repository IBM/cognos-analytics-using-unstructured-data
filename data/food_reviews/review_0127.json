The tea granules didn't dissolve easily at all and I had to \"mash\" them against the side of the cup several times to get them to mix. However, this was expected. The instructions on the box says to put the powder into a 16 oz. bottle and shake. We don't use plastic bottles so that wasn't an option. The mix did completely dissolve, eventually.<br /><br />I found the flavor way too sweet for my taste. That's pretty impressive since it's supposed to be only 5 calories, makes me wonder about the amount of artificial sweeteners. The blackberry was all I tasted. I kinda missed the pomegranate and tea flavors though. I detected no honey flavor.<br /><br />I'll drink it again, but I'll dilute it more."}
