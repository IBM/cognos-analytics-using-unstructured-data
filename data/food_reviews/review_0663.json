I ordered the french vanilla cappuccino because I was looking for something delicious that doesn't require the extra effort of adding cream and sugar. This is exactly that! I went through the 24 pack in 2-3 weeks and will definitely be ordering another box soon! I would recommend these for anyone that enjoys french vanilla flavor and normally adds cream and sugar to their coffee."}
