At the time, I thought the 'frustration free' box and Coffee People cups were great.  But over the years the price has creeped up and it was brought up my little cups weren't exactly 'green.'  HMPH!  SF Coffee Pod change everything.  First of all it tastes great.  It is the closest to a cup of coffee from a coffee house.  The pod design allows for a greener pod, but also more coffee per pod than a traditional Kcup.  But the real advantage is having the wonderful smell of coffee.  I've missed it.  I have a done of airtight plastic containers that keep the pods fresh and look forward to opening it and smelling the coffee.  :)<br /><br />if you are looking for an alternative for you Keurig, give this a try.  It wins on many levels including, price, taste and smell.  Real coffee fans will understand what I mean."}
