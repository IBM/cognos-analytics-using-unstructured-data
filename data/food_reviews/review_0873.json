As far as grounds I have had none.  On the taste of the coffee, it's ok.  They claim flavor match to green mountain breakfast blend....not sure about that as I find it be a little more bitter on the back end.  Is it bad, no its not.  Is it a memorable cup of coffee not really.  Overall I put it in the same class as folders meaning somebody hands you a cup and you will drink it, but probably not ask what it was (good or bad).<br /><br />******Update 4-28-12******<br /><br />After my initial review, I was contacted by Brooklyn Bean Roastery asking if they could send me sample of the other roasts of coffe.  Today FedEx just dropped off 36 k-cups mixed between the different roasts.  Currently, I am drinking the Colombian and find it  to be very good.  Total I have run 15-20 of there k-cups through my Cuisinart with no grounds and no unusually long brew times.  Overall, I will keep my subscription I have change to a different blend than the breakfast blend which I originally ordered."}
