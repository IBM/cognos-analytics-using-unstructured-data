However I really don't care for the Fuhgeddaboutit flavor.  It tastes like cheap instant coffee.  Very ashy and bland.<br /><br />6/15/12 Update:<br />Thank you Brooklyn Bean for the excellent response and the variety box.  After tasting all the flavors I've determined that I just don't like the dark roasts from Brooklyn Bean.  I like the medium and light roasts.<br /><br />However I am getting a lot of grounds in my cup from quite a few of these.  Our commercial machines at work really don't like these for some reason."}
