I drink about three gallons of unsweetened tea every week.  Normally I prefer unsweetened tea but when I was offered this product I noticed that it said it was slightly sweetened.  I couldn't wait to make my first drink.  You take a bottle of cold water, tear open the packet and pour it into the bottle.  Replace the cap and shake.  This tea does take a little longer to mix so you have to give it quite a few shakes but that isn't a problem.  The taste is lovely.  It takes like tea and fruit.  Honey is used as the sweetener and there is just a little bit added so it isn't too sweet.  It's just perfect.  I guzzled that first drink down and now I'm working on a second... I'm going to put some packets in my purse so I can make tea when I'm out and about."}
