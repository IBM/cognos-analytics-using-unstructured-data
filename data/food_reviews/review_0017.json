With separate powder packages intended for single servings, this is a product that's perfect for use at the office or on travel.  My only complaint is that the amount of power seems excessive for a sincle serving, making it difficult to dissolve the entire packet even in a pint-sized glass and leaving unwanted residue in the glass."}
