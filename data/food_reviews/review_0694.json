Flavor","text":"I'm on the fence with Grove Square's Cappuccino Cups - French Vanilla.<br /><br />On one hand, for the price at least, they're great. Sadly on the other hand, they're way too sweet for an every morning drink. The first time I tried it, I had already added cream and sugar before I ever took a sip. That was a bad idea.<br /><br />I'd buy it again in a lesser Qty, but 54 of these is going to last me a long time. They aren't bad at all, I just wasn't expecting such a sweet drink."}
