I may never go to Starbuck's again!  This coffe is just strong enough, not too bitter.  Also has a smooth and sweet taste from the french vanilla.  And, the best part is each cup is only 80 calories!  I will definitely order this brand again.  I'm usually a hot chocolate or mocha coffee drinker, but this will be my coffee of choice and I will always have on hand to brew a fresh cup."}
