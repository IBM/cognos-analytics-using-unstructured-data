Very refreshing","text":"This is the second green tea drink stick blend I have tried from Lipton, the first being the \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QH41OG\">Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai, 10-Count (1 Box)</a>\".  Mango Pineapple Green Tea is the flavor mixture in question.  I must say that the taste is really good and all the key ingredients shine through.  In other words, I can taste green tea, mango, pineapple and even a touch of honey, yet none of the flavors are too over bearing.<br /><br />These drink sticks (10 in a box) are 5 calories a serving and taste like they are much higher in calories. It took me a little extra effort to mix the powder into the water, but nevertheless the powder dissolved.  I must say there is a slight, slight aftertaste.  It isn't bad per se but it is worth noting.  I didn't find it to be a big deal or would prevent me from purchasing in the future, yet it should be noted.<br /><br />I believe that Lipton has stepped their game up with these drink mixes and I love the idea that green tea is being utilized.  Green tea is underrated so it is nice that it is being promoted more."}
