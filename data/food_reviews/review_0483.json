Therefore, I purposely only tried the Columbian.<br /><br />I work in a place that has poorly serviced coffee \"dispensing machines.\" They are fun in that you never know what will come out in a day-to-day basis. Some time just your coins back. A few people have illicit electric coffee pots, others use a French press, and still others sneak out for the real thing.<br /><br />Now that I discovered the Columbian Via. I have to defend my cup from all those noses that circle my cup. I know there are directions on the pack; however, I now have my own ritual. Clean cup, fill 2/3rds filtered water. 90 seconds in the microwave. Shake contents to bottom of pack. Rip the whole top off the pack with teeth. Pour pack in coup and watch sizzle. Stir for a few seconds. Add a tad of ice. Hope I can make it back to my desk before the cup empties.<br /><br />I was never a fan of reconstituted coffee however I think it is the addition of the micro-ground coffee that adds the edge necessary.<br /><br />In any event you owe it to yourself to try it."}
