My personal favorite decaf has always been Timothy's Colombian, but this is a nice, slightly milder alternative.  In fact, I couldn't tell you which of the two I like more.<br /><br />One strange issue - all the cups I've brewed up so far (we have a Keurig B70 Platinum) have brewed very slowly.  There might be an issue with the internal filter not allowing the water to move through quick enough.  No explosions or overflows, but not that great if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />UPDATE: Explosion time!  Don't you hate it when you get a cupful of grounds?  Don't think I'll be buying these again.  Oh well."}
