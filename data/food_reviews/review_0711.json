I pre-ordered this one as well as the french vanilla one and they are both horrible. The consistency, taste, and smell are exactly like the cappucino you get out of those machines at the gas station. Don't bother, there are way better k-cups out there...the green mountain espresso one and the gloria jean cappucino ones are much better. Yes you have to mix your own milk in, but you can get creative and get a cheap foamer to use with different flavored creamers. Way better."}
