When Amazon sent me an email with a link to this coffee it was cheap enough that I thought I would give it a try. I use and love Newman's Own Organic-Caribou Blend and Sumatran Reserve on a daily basis. The price on those k-cups right now is $65 to $.70 per k-cup. I am always looking for a good bold k-cup that is less expensive. These look different than a k-cup and they need to be in an airtight container after you open them. You need a small container as you only open 12 at a time-the rest stay vacuum sealed. I can't understand the fuss about the packaging-it is a simple thing to put them in a Tupperware type container. The bottom line for me is that the subscription price for this coffer is about $.41 per serving as opposed to $.70 per serving-and the coffee is GREAT! I love the coffee and I now drink it daily. I have not given up the expensive blends that I love-but this one works for me for my 3rd and 4th cup of the day. Just give it a try-some of you will not like it-but some of you will find it to be an excellent and reasonably priced supplement to those very expensive k-cups that we all love."}
