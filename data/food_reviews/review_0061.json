The Lipton To Go Green Tea Mix Mango Pineapple is my newest addiction.  It is amazing and so delicious!  I am totally addicted to it and have cut back my soda intake and am drinking way more water. The packets are convenient enough that I can carry them with me in my purse and I can even stretch one packet to two bottles of water without really sacrificing taste. I warn you though that these are addicting!  The flavor is sweet and rich, but not overpowering.  The best part is they are only 5 calories which is nothing compared to my usual can of soda."}
