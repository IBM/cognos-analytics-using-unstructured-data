Bold, yet not \"too\" strong.<br />The cup design seems to work/brew okay, just maybe allows for a small amount of \"fines\" to sneak into the coffee cup.<br />The price is attractive and makes it a \"re-buy\" if I'm running low on Coffee People Donut Shop...<br />These need to be kept in a air tight container. I use a zip baggie."}
