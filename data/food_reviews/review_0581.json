I did not want some fancy cappuccino, but something comparable to the stuff I pay $1.50 for in the mornings.  Well, this stuff was very good.  VERY comparable to the machine cappuccino, sweet, smooth, good flavor.  For under $10 a box it comes to around .40 a cup which is great compared to the $1.30+ at the store.  I definitely would recommend it."}
