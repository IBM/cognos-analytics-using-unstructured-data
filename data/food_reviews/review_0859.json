If you have ever tried to reuse a k-cup you'll understand what this coffee tastes like.  I did an experiment weighing five different brands of coffee and found all to be 1/2 oz. or more except Brooklyn and it weighed one tenth of an ounce.  That's 1/5 the weight of Dunkin' Donuts, Newman's Own, Millstone and 1/6 the weight of Starbucks.  This is the second time I've ordered coffee from Amazon and found it to be lacking.  Since they won't take returns, (even from prime members) I don't think I'll order any more coffee from Amazon in the future.  The reason I titled this review the second worst coffee was because I got tricked into buying a coffee that was really just instant coffee in a k-cup cartridge.  On second thought that actually was better than this."}
