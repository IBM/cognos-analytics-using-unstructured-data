Attracted to the product by its bargain price, I'm reminded you often get what you buy.  While the coffee tastes OK, it's no better than most other brands I've purchased.  This is the ONLY brand I've purchased, though, that has a defect about 50% of the time.  Coffee goes into the cup and sprays into the cup holder which ruins the beverage.  With only about half of the cups working properly that effectively doubles the cost making it anything but a bargain.  I will not purchase again and, if asked, will recommend against purchases."}
