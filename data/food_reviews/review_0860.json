I stumbled upon the Corner Donut Shop item and pre-ordered it before it was ready to ship. It arrived a couple of weeks ago and I have gone through almost my first whole box of 36. Out of those 36, 22 of the cups did not brew correctly and left me with a disappointing cup (or partial cup) of coffee. Most of the failures left grounds floating in the cup which was not good, but some of the cups left grounds all over the inside of the machine and required me to clean up.<br />BUT, of those cups that brewed correctly, WOW! The coffee is great. It has a great flavor that is reminiscent of a donut chain that has great coffee and does not have a bitter after taste like some of the k-cups I have tried.<br />I give the rating a 3 which is the mean of a 5 for taste and a 1 for packaging.<br />I'll wait a few months and see if this product is still being offered and try it again. Who knows, maybe they'll fix the packaging by then?!"}
