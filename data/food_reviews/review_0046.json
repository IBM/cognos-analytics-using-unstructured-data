Sweetened with honey?  Right. Read the fine print. This is a cocktail of artificial and \"natural flavor\", stuff that should never be in a fine brew. It leaves an after taste that just won't go away and to put it nicely, well . . I can't put it nicely. Awful awful stuff! This one doesn't deserve a rating."}
