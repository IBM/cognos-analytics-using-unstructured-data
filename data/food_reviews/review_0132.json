Morrill\"","HelpfulnessNumerator":1,"HelpfulnessDenominator":1,"Score":3,"Time":"1333065600","Summary":"Misleading and far too sweet","text":"I love tea.  Iced tea, hot tea, green tea, black tea, all kinds.  I was excited to try this product because I am always short on time and thought a powdered, just add water mix would be great.  One major problem, this \"tea\" has zero tea flavor.  It also claims to be \"sweetened with honey\" but it is actually sweetened with sucralose in addition to \"honey granules\".  Because of this, it has a very strong \"diet\" aftertaste, something I am not fond of at all.  Overall the drink was far too sweet for my liking even though I made it with 20oz of water instead of the 16 recommended.  I was really disappointed by this product.  I also feel the packaging is hugely misleading.  It says, and I quote; \"Sweetened with honey\" with no mention of the sucralose.  It does mention \"no aspartame\" but fails to mention it's other source of sweetness.  The ingredients are as follows: Honey granules (sugar, honey), Citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, malodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, and Beta carotene for color.  As far as powdered diet drinks go, this one would be low on my list.  Even drinks like Crystal light do not have this strong of a diet aftertaste."}
