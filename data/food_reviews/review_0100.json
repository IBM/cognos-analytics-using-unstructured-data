Why mess with a good thing? I loved the old flavors, Citrus and Apple Cranberry were the best! Lipton has done away with them for this new line of horrible tasting drink mixes!! I bought this flavor and it is awful!! I can't even describe to you what it tastes like, it is very bad . Nothing like strawberry....I can't stand it! LIPTON....BRING BACK THE OLD FLAVORS!!! I won't be buying this crap!"}
