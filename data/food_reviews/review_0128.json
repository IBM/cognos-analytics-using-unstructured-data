I would love to not be constantly purchasing all the big jugs, and the idea of having something that generates less trash is incredibly appealing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he thought there were \"too many different flavors\" in this, and he suggested I let the kids have the rest of the box.  He also complained about a funny aftertaste.  I chalked it up to him just being picky.<br /><br />The kids liked the flavor.  Their complaint was that it is pretty much impossible to mix in a glass (in a water bottle it was easy though).  And they also complained of a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />With all of that, though, they did continue to ask for more until the box was empty.<br /><br />So, mixed reviews from my family."}
