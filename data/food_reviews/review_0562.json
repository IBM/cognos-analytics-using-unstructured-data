I am only alowed to leave on some days and this is a great size for me. The shipping is resonibly fast and when it gets here I will have plenty of coffee to last me a while. Personally I drink 3-5 cups a day and this price is a great deal rather than Walmart 8 packets for 7 dollars or 50 packets for 28 dollars. Personally I think this price is a great deal. The seller has shipped my item about 30 min after I ordered it. It will be here very soon on free standard shipping."}
