After reading my feedback the Brooklyn Bean Roastery service representatives contacted me (and other customers with the same issue) and assured me that the manufacturing package defect has now been corrected and offered to replace my original order. They kept their word and after verifying my purchase order details on Amazon.com my coffee replacement was sent to me via FedEx within 48 hours! It is obvious that their prior defects have been corrected - the coffee is fantastic and the new k-cups are problem-free. So if you enjoy good coffee - give this seller another chance to satisfy your taste-buds! Amazon.com customer's review feedback is important - your comments actually make a world of difference to future customers as well to sellers and manufacturers. Always be honest!"}
