It couldn't be easier to make--just add to a glass of some cool or chilled water and stir. The honey, mango-pineapple flavor is very refreshing and I really agree with people who write that it's even better than soda on a hot day--and we'll be getting hot days here in New York for the next several months so this couldn't have come to me at a better time!<br /><br />It's the taste that really wows me. It's smooth and not too sweet as others say; and the packets are small enough that I can easily carry a bunch with me and then buy (or bring with me) bottled cold water to mix it with. If you're on the run, I think mixing the powder into the water using a small swizzle stick should work.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product. It's a mere five calories so unless you're drinking huge amounts of it you certainly won't gain any weight--this is very good tea!"}
