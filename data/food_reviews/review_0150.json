There is a cut at one end that allows you to open the foil package so none of the usual difficulties with getting these things open just to spill out some of the contents. The package says to mix with one 16-ounce bottle of water.<br /><br />The powder mixed into the water completely by the time I was ready to put the lid on to shake it up.  It turned the water a light pink.  This flavor of Stix To Go does not have aspartame in it.  The box says sweetened with honey and indeed honey granules are the first ingredients, however there is also sucralose, similar to Splenda.  There is also maltodextrin, which is often used in soda or candy as a thickener, but it is made from real food not chemicals.  The other ingredients are the flavors and hibiscus extract.  WebMD says that hibiscus extract is used to improve odor, flavor, and appearance of tea.  The package also says that a serving size is half of a package at five calories, but you are told to add the whole package to a bottle of water, so beware if you are counting calories.<br /><br />The taste is not bad.  I do not drink anything with artificial sweeteners because I cannot stand the aftertaste, but I did not notice an aftertaste with this.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it did not last.  If think you are getting tea you are not.  This taste like kid's strawberry drink.  If you just can't drink water then you would probably like this."}
