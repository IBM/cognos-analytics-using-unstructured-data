I decided to try the Brooklyn Bridge Blend because I do like Green Mountain Nantucket Blend. I am about half way through the box with no no brewing failures in my 2006 B50 Keurig brewer. It is not quite the same flavor as the Nantucket blend (in my opinion), but it is not bad at all. It is a bit stronger, and has a bit of an aftertaste that I associate with stronger roast (like French Roast). I will probably try their Colombian next - but would buy this one again at some point. Still searching for a good replacement for Columbian La Verde though..."}
