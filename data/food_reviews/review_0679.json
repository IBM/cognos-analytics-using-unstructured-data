It is much like oneI get from a local ice cream parlor, the drink is comforting and relaxing, good for releasing stress at a time when that is extremely high in my life.  A good way to start a busy day for extra pep, yet a good \"slow down\" in the late afternoon or early evening when I need to let go of \"life\" and rest."}
