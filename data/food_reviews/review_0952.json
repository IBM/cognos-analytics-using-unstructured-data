I ordered three 36-ct boxes. The first two arrived and I tried the coffee immediately. I got a cup full of coffee grounds. Ok, once in a while, you can get a defective K-Cup. The next 5 I tried - same thing. So I carefully cut one open to see what was going on inside, and found tears in the filter inside the cup, which of course, causes the filter to rupture and shoot a large amount of grounds in the cup.<br /><br />I did eventually hit one that was ok, and the coffee itself isn't bad. But these are very poorly manufactured K-Cups. Fortunately, Amazon refunded my purchase. I'll stick with other products."}
