It's also full of flavor, very sweet and has only 5 calories and 10mg of caffeine per 8 ounce serving.<br /><br />Ingredients: honey granules (sugar, honey) citric acid (provides tartness), green tea powder, hibiscus extract, sucralose (sweetner), maltodextrin (corn), natural flavor, blackberry juice solids, isomalt, soy lecithin, pomegranate juice solids.<br /><br />Simply delicious and I appreciate that it's low in sugar and carbs."}
