Essentially, you can take these little packets anywhere, pour it into a (standard 16.9 fl. oz.) bottle of water, and enjoy some tea. It's quick and easy, but unfortunately these Tea & Honey packets don't seem to actually work very well.<br /><br />The box warns, \"Tea takes longer to dissolve so SHAKE WELL.\" This, however, is a pretty big understatement in my experience. After pouring the powder in, I shook the bottle a couple times and found that the powder clumped together immediately. I shook and shook and shook, but to no avail. Certainly, it flavored the water, but there were also big sugar-particles floating around my bottle. I tried it once more but to the same result.<br /><br />It's really a shame because the taste is quite good, much like a pomegranate flavored-water. But along with this good taste, your mouth is filled with an unpleasant amount of sugar clumps. Of course, it would be possible to filter these out with a strainer of some kind, although that would totally defeat the convenience aspect of the product. It's unfortunate."}
