However, as soon as I tasted it I knew there was \"fake sugar\" in it- I could taste the artificial sweetener but could not taste the honey at all.  I turned the package over and sure enough, one of the listed ingredients was sucralose, which is found in Splenda.  I think the label is a bit misleading because it gives the impression that only honey is used to sweeten the product which is not the case.  The box says it does not contain aspartame, which is true, but sucralose is not much better for you and still has an artificial taste.  I didn't like this so I wouldn't buy it again, and truthfully, I would rather buy this product if it was sweetened with ONLY honey or real sugar, even if that meant it had more calories.  A spoonful of sugar only has about 20 calories- if they put one spoonful per pack and each pack makes two glasses of beverage, it would still be a low-calorie drink, it would taste better and would be more natural."}
