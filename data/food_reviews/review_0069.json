I like the fact that you put your ice and water in a glass and pour the packet of Stawberry iced tea in and stir.  It isn't overly sweet.  It tasted good and was a great alternative to soda.  I like it better than the soda stream we have and is a lot less work to make.  If you like decaf iced tea and want a different taste other than black or green tea then this is a buy!  THIS IS AN UPDATE AS OF 6/18/12.  I purchased a case of Strawberry and a case of Blackberry/Pomegrante.  I love this drink and so easy to mix!  I have also put 2 of each in my purse so when we eat out I can drink this instead of soda pop.  I make sure I have a plastic spoon in my purse.  Hope those of you who would like to try it like it as much as I do.  My husband thinks it is a really smart idea, he likes it also.  We are saving money when we eat out!"}
