I do it to save others from this awful product.  I too was so excited to try this new k-cup. With<br />high hopes I placed it in my trusty Keurig and pressed the button.  This was without a doubt the most vile bitter tasting coffee I have ever had including the stuff they sell by the<br />gallons in gas stations.  At first I could not believe it and brewed another cup as well as a cup of two other brands of k-cups, Starbucks and Green Mountain comparable dark roasts.  I<br />tasted them all black and what a difference.  Even though these are cheaper save your money, do not buy this product."}
