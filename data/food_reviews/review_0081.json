Way too sweet, overwhelms any berry flavor that is there, and no green tea flavor is discernable.  Diluting it makes the oversweetened taste become obvious as the berry flavor recedes in the distance, with still too much sweetener.  (Though if you like things extra sweet, you may enjoy this).<br /><br />Too bad.  Try the True Lemon family of unsweetened dehydrated citrus juice packets instead."}
