I didn't care so much that they weren't the same as regular K-Cups as people said they fit. They do not. On our brewer, you have to hold the handle down because the cup doesn't fit all the way down into the holder. I like to do other things while I'm brewing the coffee knowing it will be ready when I'm ready to grab it. Not so with this one. You have to babysit the machine.  We have a B-40.<br /><br />I will not buy again. THEY DO NOT FIT!"}
