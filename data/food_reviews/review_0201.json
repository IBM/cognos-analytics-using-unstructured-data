(I don't call them K-Cups just because they're made a little differently -- not encased in plastic, just a little filter filled with the grounds.)<br /><br />All the K-Cup varieties I've tried seem to brew a bit on the weak side.  This actually tastes like a full-bodied cup of coffee!  The Fog Chaser flavor is bold by nature, so if you like a milder coffee it might not be your best choice.  It's not bitter like some bold coffees can be -- it's actually quite smooth and seems to have very low acidity.<br /><br />My favorite way to enjoy coffee has always been a French press, but since I found this Fog Chaser coffee I haven't used my press in months.  It's that good."}
