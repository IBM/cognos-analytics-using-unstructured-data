What I received was a coffee pod that is smaller in size than a K cup and appears to be a \"filter\" type material vice a plastic container.  As a result, they do not fit in the standard K cup dispensers and the coffee does not stay fresh like the standard K cup.  It appears the \"filter\" type material (like fine rice paper) of this coffee pod allows free flow of air and allows the coffee to go stale.  Requires you to store the coffee pods in a zip lock bag to ensure freshness remains.<br /><br />I will not buy these type K coffee pods again and I am surprised that the Amazon web site does not clearly identify the K cup material issue<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++<br />UPDATE-I emailed Amazon regarding the web site issue not being clear as to KCup packaging type.  Amazon refunded my money since they want the customer happy.  Amazon is a great place to shop and has high customer focus and is very much appreciated."}
