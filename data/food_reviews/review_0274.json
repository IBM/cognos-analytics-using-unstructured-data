THis is by far THE BEST approach to this one cup (kcup) system. Not dispensing with the pod system, which is slightly less toxic to the environment. Ok, so without a doubt a step in the right direction on the kcup systems; but the coffee....WOW..this stuff hits your nose when you open the bag and keeps hitting it each time I open the zip lock I put them into, after opening the original ( slight dig on the company for not making a resealable bag..come on man!  Anyway, can't say enough about the coffee, I have tried just about every bold, dark, espresso, medium roast, you name it, and this one is my favorite so far.<br />I may have to buy some beans or grounds to use to make my own.<br /><br />Thanks!"}
