But this product is not SB's best effort.  First, the packaging isn't well designed.  Tearing the top off at the \"tear here\" line always leaves part of the top intact, making getting the coffee out a chore, and trying to tear off the rest of the sticky top is not worth the effort.  Next, the flavor.  I know Italian is supposed to be bold and bitter, but this stuff takes bitter to a whole new level.  Not good.  Then there's the expiration.  I didn't plan to use this very often, but I'd better, because it expires in less than a month.  What?  Finally, the cost.  At nearly a dollar a cup, this wouldn't be worth it even if it didn't suffer from its other inadequacies.  A definite DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
