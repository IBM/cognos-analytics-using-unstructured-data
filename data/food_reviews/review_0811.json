But I can honestly say, aside from a fresh brewed batch of Peet's from the French press, this is the BEST I've had.  It beats by far any other K cup I've tried.  Leave it to Brooklyn Beans, inspired by the new nexus of the foodie world, to perfect coffee in the convenience of a K cup!  Well done!"}
