One \"stick\" makes 16 oz of iced tea when mixed with water. (Note, the nutrition information shown on the package is for 8 oz, so you need to double the nutritional values if you consume the whole beverage.)<br />The tea crystals do not dissolve easily, it will take some time to do it right. The flavor is variable, from sweet to sour to bitter at times.<br />The sweeteners include honey, sugar and suclarose (Splenda.) Blackberry and pomegranate is an odd combination,  but is not too bad. The packets are small and easy to carry around with you. If you like, you can just dissolve a packet into a 16 oz container of bottled water on the go. It is an ok drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."}
