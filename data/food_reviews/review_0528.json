Since its a new product, Starbucks take notice: the 50pc half-filled non-descript recycled box packaging it comes in is really lame; It came crushed in the order. Moreover, the packets do not tear fully at the perforated line.<br /><br />Instead, try the VIA Colombia and VIA Mocha flavors. The packaging is the same but the flavor is rich and smooth and tastes brewed."}
