I enjoyed this drink mix.  But I would have to say that the mango pineapple version of this is slightly better.  The sticks/packets are  also very convenient.  Each packet is just enough for a 16 ounce water bottle.  After a vigorous shake, the powder totally dissolves.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it is less than the Crystal Light drink mixes.  These are good for quick, on-the- go drinks."}
