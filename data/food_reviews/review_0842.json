We were very disappointed. The aroma and taste were more reminiscent of vending machine coffee. If you are expecting something similar to Starbucks, Tullys or Green Mountain French Roast this coffee is not for you. Very weak and not full bodied like you would expect from a French Roast, even on the strongest setting on our Keurig machine."}
