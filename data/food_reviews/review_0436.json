The Via coffees taste a little different than a drip pot method, but it is much quicker, easier and leaves no mess. You just heat water in a microwave, add the coffee from the packet, stir and drink.<br /><br />I purchased these for my wife, but I occasionally have one as well. She is a stay at home mom and this quick, easy coffee is the best option."}
