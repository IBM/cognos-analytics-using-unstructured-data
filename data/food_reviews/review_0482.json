It is fast, convenient and now affordable. I used to buy this product at Costco, now I don't have to drive there to get it for the price. I do drink one or two daily so this will last me for about a month. The expiration date on this was March 2013, almost 9 months. I would order again. 5 stars for the cost and convenience! thanks starbucks and amazon!"}
