I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.<br />For years, I have been using the same coffee brand ( med or dark, middle-of-the road priced) and it was affordable and it tasted just fine. Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more \"green\" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging. Now I don't feel guilty when I indulge with more than 1 K cup. For loose coffee to put into the reusable cup I choose a def. dark roast like italian or french, which is very comparable to the Fog chaser's aroma."}
