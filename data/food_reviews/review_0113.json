This one is super rich. I diluted per instructions and still needed to add more water to get the right flavor.<br />Needless to say you can really taste the acai and strawberry with the honey sweetness...the tea part...not so much...therefore the 3 stars. If you are looking for an intense flavored drink mix. This one packs a punch and you definitely get your money's worth.<br />If you are looking for a Tea...this might not be up your alley.<br />Definitely the Kool-Aid on the go for adults!!!"}
