A bottle of water, a slip of a package and away I go.<br /><br />The best part of this tea not only the connivance of travel, the cost but the taste!  Each and every one of the different flavors  I say ...Oh!  This is my favorite ..Actually All of the flavors are my favorite.<br /><br />The only draw back and it is minor, you have to really shake the powder to get it to smooth out.  Like I said a minor mention.<br /><br />When I first tested this tea, I looked but did not find them in any green grocery, now, well every where you look ...you find them.. I purchased  for my hubby, who keeps them with him while at work and myself to keep extra in the car... both of us enjoy the taste of the Lipton To Go Green tea with all the great flavors."}
