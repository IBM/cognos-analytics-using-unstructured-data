When I got mine it says it doesn't expire for another year! I mean make sure when you order it's from Starbucks and I'd say your good. It's such a great buy and comes in a very nice pop open box thing that makes it simple to grab a ready brew in the mornings and pop it open and pour it into my hot water. I own a Keurig so I just make it brew hot water and then I use these, it's so much cheaper than k-cups and the taste is the same great Starbucks taste I get at their stores! The colombia blend is my favorite blend at Starbucks, it offers a nice bold flavor but it's not too strong and the finish is just fantastic, I recommend Baileys Caramel Creamer to add to your cup of coffee of Colombia, you will have to buy the creamer at your local grocery store though since it needs to be refrigerated. I can't say enough about how great of a buy this is, the only thing I would change is making it a Amazon Prime item, I am a Prime member and love the free 2 day shipping, but had to pay shipping on this since it wasn't prime, other than that, this is my new favorite must have here on Amazon!"}
