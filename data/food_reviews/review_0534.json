These are so handy and so tasty!","text":"These are great for traveling, camping, those cold mornings when you've forgotten to get the coffee maker ready the night before or when your late and don't have time.  It's a very deep flavor which I think is great, especially with a little creamer...it really has that starbucks latte flavor.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  AND GREAT PRICE compared to the store!  We keep the decaf kind on hand too for evenings on the deck...can't say enough about it!  AWESOME!"}
