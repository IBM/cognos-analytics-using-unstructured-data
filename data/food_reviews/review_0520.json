I prefer the bold to extra-bold coffees, but enjoy most of Starbucks (non-flavored) varieties. I completely avoided instant coffee until I tried Starbucks Via. I was amazed! In the time it takes to boil water, I can have a full-flavored, aromatic cup of coffee. My office has a Bunn hot-water dispenser which cuts the time to seconds! Now I take the VIA packs camping, boating and always have a few in my brief case when traveling on business. They are pricey when bought at the local supermarket, but the Amazon price on the 50-pack brings the cost down to .65 per cup."}
