I just gulped down 16 ounces of water flavored with one of these Lipton Tea&Honey packets and I really loved it!<br /><br />But, then again, mango is one of my favorite flavors. Pineapple is in there, too, but I think the mango stands out. Either way, it tastes delicious.<br /><br />You just empty one of the long, narrow packets into 16.9-ounces of water -- either a bottle (and shake well) or a glass (and stir well). I used a glass of water, but will try it in a bottle of water on my next long, hot walk.<br /><br />Packets are scored, so they're easy to open -- a real plus -- and easy to pour into either a bottle or a glass.<br /><br />Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors. Ingredients: honey granules (sugar, honey), citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, maltodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, beta carotene (for color). (NO aspartame.)<br /><br />Calories 5. Zero Fat. Zero Sodium. Sugars 1g. Vitamin A 10%. 10mg caffeine per 8 fl oz serving (2 servings/packet).<br /><br />Lipton, you've got a winner here! Great product!<br /><br />UPDATE: The day after writing this review, I filled up a 33.8 ounce bottle with water, poured in ONE packet of \"To Go Stix\" and took it on a 6-hour road trip. Flavor and sweetness held up well in twice the amount of recommended liquid and the drive didn't seem nearly as long as usual."}
