But things have changed with VIA. I picked up a 3 pack from the grocery store to test it out, cost me like $3 which is insane for instant coffee. $1 per serving compared to 10 cents with other brands. But, when i tried the Starbucks Via Columbia I had no regrets. Far superior then any instant. I'm not big on Starbucks, i have never ordered coffee from Starbucks. In fact, i'm shocked they got this far with the prices and silly names for sizes, etc. The entire experience going into a Starbucks makes me roll my eyes and leave everytime. But anyway, this instant coffee has great roasted taste and aroma. I'll def buy this in bulk from amazon. The 50 count for $29 breaks down to about 60 cents per cup, which the best way to go. You'd have to grind and brew at home to get this quality/price."}
