Now I'm hooked","text":"I wasn't much of a coffee drinker before. Once in awhile I'd go to Starbucks to get an iced coffee but that was probably once a month and for awhile not having any coffee at all for a year. So it's not something I drank much.<br /><br />I have tried some other instant coffees from my girlfriend but didn't like them so much.<br /><br />Then we tried the Starbucks VIA. The flavor of it is perfect for what I like! It's so easy to make. The instant coffee tastes better than anything I can buy at Starbucks so I never go and buy a coffee. This saves me a lot of money.<br /><br />Since I don't drink much coffee, one cup of this has enough \"kick\" to keep me up all day long.<br /><br />Now I drink a cup of coffee but I go running and it makes me feel like I can run much longer.<br /><br />So I would highly recommend this. Again I wasn't a two cup of coffee per day person but now 2-3 times a week, I enjoy a cup of Starbucks VIA."}
