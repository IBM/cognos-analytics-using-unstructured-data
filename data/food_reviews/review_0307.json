However, there are only 12 cups per bag, so I didn't find any flavor loss when I clipped the bag closed. I used 12 in about 15-18 days.<br /><br />I loved the flavor: a nice, rich cup when set on medium setting on my Keurig (which is what I always use except for some weak flavored blends). They fit perfectly in my B70 Keurig -- and I love saving on extra packaging.<br /><br />But I had a problem I don't see anyone else mentioning: Of the 36 cups total, 3 were duds. The water flowed them, but only light brown water came out. Three out of 36 is too high a failure rate for me. With regular k-cups (of which I've used at least 1200 in 5 years), I've only had maybe 5 duds.<br /><br />Therefore I rate this as 3-stars for now (not less as I don't see anyone else having had this problem). I might try this or another flavor again at some point because the coffee is good and the price is right. Then we'll see..."}
