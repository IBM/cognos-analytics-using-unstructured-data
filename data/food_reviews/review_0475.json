I believe the iced via version simply includes sugar. Essentially you can probably mix this product with some sugar and get the same exact product as the iced vias. The only difference is, the iced vias serve 1 16oz drink per packet, while these serve 1 8oz drink.<br /><br />I can't tell the difference between this and columbia, both taste the same to me."}
