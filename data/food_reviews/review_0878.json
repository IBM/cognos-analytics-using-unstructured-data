A lot of other people have voiced the same problem and my description is the same.  Foil comes loose, coffee cup only halfway full, and lots of grounds in my cup.  If I could rate them separately, I would give the coffee 4 stars and the cups 1 star.  I have considered busting them open and putting the coffee in my re-useable cup."}
