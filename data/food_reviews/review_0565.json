I developed a preference for Casi Cielo / French Pressed at home.  When Via came on the market, I was excited because I love Starbucks, but it's such a hassle to fit in the time to find an outlet/get there/ stand in line, etc when traveling.<br />And then came Via Columbia.  I have been transported to a heavenly world of flavor, instant availability even when traveling and a reasonable price besides!  Thank you, Starbucks, for this amazing and delightful coffee....far and away the most incredibly delicious thing I put in my mouth each day!"}
