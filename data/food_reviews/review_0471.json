I don't drink much instant coffee but I've tried several other brands in the past and didn't think this Starbucks instant coffee could be much better. I was wrong. Starbucks Via instant coffee tastes as close as you can get to regular brewed coffee. I was shocked at how good it is. It's rich, bold, and flavorful. The only downside is the price - it's significantly more than other brands of instant coffees. I still drink mostly fresh brewed coffee but when I can't and need instant I drink Starbucks Via"}
