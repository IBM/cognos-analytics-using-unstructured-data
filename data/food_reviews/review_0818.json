What impressed me was that every one of those reviews was answered by a company representative and appropriate compensation was offered to each buyer.  So for that reason, I overlooked the negatives and decided to buy.<br /><br />The coffee arrived at my front door the next day.  So far, I have had  no issues with coffee grounds and breaking K-cups. I'm certainly not a coffee expert, but I can honestly say that I am enjoying the Breakfast Blend--and the price was great.<br /><br />Keep up the good work, and thanks for the great coffee."}
