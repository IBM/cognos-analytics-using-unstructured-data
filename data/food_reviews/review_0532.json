Inside, there was coffee grounds all over the box and stuck to all the packets was this gritty stuff. There were 2 sleeves of VIA that were obviously opened and causing the mess in the box. Each of these packets also had a blue sticker! So it was pretty obvious that I was shipped a known defective product. When I called Starbucks, at first they wouldn't help me and treated me like they didn't ship this item (because I ordered thru Amazon) and would not replace this product. They said I would have to pay to ship it back to them and they would send a refund. I didn't want a refund, I just wanted the product replaced. They said that after I returned it, I would have to completely reorder and pay for the product. I called the customer service again and got the run-around. There customer service is awful. I guess they figure they can afford to lose a customer if they behave this way. That is why I am posting this review....<br />I would not recommend buying from Starbucks."}
