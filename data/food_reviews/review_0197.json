More eco-friendly than all-plastic K-Cups. A mesh bag holds the coffee with no plastic aftertaste. Some reviewers worried that they come in un-resealable plastic bags & not in a fancy, colorful box. I keep them in a zipper-lock plastic bag for freshness and don't worry about not having a pretty box taking up room on the kitchen counter. Enjoy fresh-brewed taste and eco-friendly packaging & forget the box!"}
