Maxwell House isn't exactly top shelf. Personally, it's not as good as Donut Shop but it is 13 cents per cup less when you subscribe and save.<br /><br />I love the packaging where the bottom is a coffee filter and not a k cup. Since it's not the proprietary k cup design, they can probably avoid royalties to Keurig. But in the end you drink coffee not for looks or cost but taste. And while it tastes OK, there are tastier options out there."}
