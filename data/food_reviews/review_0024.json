I love nearly all drinks that contain blackberry or pomegranate so I thought this would be a home run.  What a disappointment!  I cannot even describe the taste aside from to say it is very artificial.  The clean crisp natural taste that was expected never occurred throughout the two packages that I drank.  The smell was even artificial.  In fact when I first smelled it, I nearly dumped it down the drain.  It also took some time and a lot of shaking for all of the particles to dissolve into the water.  I did not enjoy this product and will probably not buy or even finish the remaining in the package that I have."}
