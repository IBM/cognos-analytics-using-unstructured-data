Unfortunately, without the ice it was too overpoweringly sweet. Taste-wise it didn't taste as much like brewed tea and instead tasted like the typical sweet tea that comes out of a soda tap machine.<br /><br />It tasted good w/ a mango taste if not tea like. I'd recommend it only to be used in small amount rather than the entire package per cup."}
