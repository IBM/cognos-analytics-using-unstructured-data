This tastes like Kool-Aid, the sugar free kind. The immediate smell when I first opened the package brought me back to sitting on the counter as a kid while my filled that huge green pitcher, right before we dumped that magical powder turning water into the sweet taste of my childhood.<br /><br />It may very well be sweetened with honey, but it still has a very slight saccharine taste. An odd thing about this drink mix is the variation in flavor depending on how much water you add to the mix. You have to go pretty light on the water if you want it to taste at all like tea, but that makes the saccharine taste a little too strong. Heavier on the water makes it taste like Kool-Aid. That's fine with me, because I like Kool-Aid. This may, however, be an expensive way to go about a glass."}
