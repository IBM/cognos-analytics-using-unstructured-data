They brew a nice strong cup of coffee.  Bold flavor without bitterness.  These pods work great in my Keurig.  They brew a great clean cup of coffee.  I haven't had a problem with freshness because I go through a twelve pack in a few days.  If you want a flavorful and bold cup of coffee give Fog Chaser a try."}
