Mango is the predominant flavor, with hints of green tea and pineapple. Refreshing!<br />* Lower in calories than many of the sugared drinks on the market, making for a more nutritionally-sound purchase<br />* Quick and easy to make, without having to wait for tea to brew and cool<br />* Mixes well in water<br /><br />The BAD:<br />* Those wanting to shy away from artificial sweeteners may not like the addition of sucralose<br />* Not quite as cost-effective as simply brewing bags or loose leaf tea<br /><br />The VERDICT:<br /><br />* A winner! Lower pricing and alternative natural sweeteners (such as stevia extract) would have pushed it to a 5, but the Lipton To Go Stix are definitely an easy and tasty drink, wherever you go!<br /><br />Nutritional Content:<br /><br />Serving Size 1/2 packet (1.9g)<br />(makes 8 fl oz prepared)<br />Servings Per Container: 20<br /><br />Amount Per Serving:<br />Calories: 5<br />Total Fat: 0g<br />Sodium: 0g<br />Total Carbohydrate: 1g (0%)<br />Sugars: 1g<br />Protein: 0g<br />Vitamin A: 10%<br /><br />Ingredients: Honey Granules (Sugar, Honey), Citric Acid (Provides Tartness), Green Tea Powder, Sucralose (Sweetener), Maltodextrin (Corn), Hibiscus Extract, Natural Flavor, Beta Carotene (For Color)"}
