If you're using it with a cup or glass, rather than a bottle of water, I strongly suggest having an inch or so of water in the bottom before you pour the packet in to avoid wheezy clouds of powder; not having a full cup also seems to facilitate mixing the powder, then you can fill the cup up. VERY tasty stuff!!"}
