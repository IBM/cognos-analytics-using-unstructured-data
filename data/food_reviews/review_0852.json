I drink it all day long.  But sometimes I want decaf, especially in the evening or when I'm not feeling well.  I recently got a Keurig machine so I gave these a try.  The decaf is delicious.  It's smooth, goes well with flavored creamers or half and half, and is strong without the caffeine.  I'm really not sure what everyone is complaining about.  I love the price, and I'm going to order some of the other flavors.  This package was a gift from my boyfriend.  Guess he's a smart guy!"}
