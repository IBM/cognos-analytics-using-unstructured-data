If you enjoy a dark roast or coffee that is bitter and dark this is not for you. Its light and the taste is easy to drink.  My wife doesn't like a cup loaded with caffeine so this fit the bill for her.  I love that I can brew and go! No sugar or creamer needed unless you have a crazy sweet tooth.  I put a couple k cups to fit in a travel mug and I'm always sorry when its gone.  That means I will have to go back to the truely terrible coffee at work!"}
