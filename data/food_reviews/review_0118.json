And the other brands have less of an aftertaste.  But the primary reason for the average rating is that this powder doesn't dissolve easily in water.  I had to stir quite a bit yet sometimes there were still small clumps of powder floating in the drink. I've never had that problem with competitive products and for that reason alone I'm unlikely to buy this product in the future."}
