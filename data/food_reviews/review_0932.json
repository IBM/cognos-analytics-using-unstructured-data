Save your money!","text":"We're heavy K cup users at our house, and always look forward to trying new types. I was excited to see this one listed, and ordered right away.  Wow! What a disappointment! When I opened the box, there was loose coffee all over the place, and the lids look like someone sat in front of their tv and glued them on by hand. So ok, I could probably have lived with that, but when I brewed it, it was terrible--nothing like any of the others on the market. It just tasted like old stale coffee.  I tried to return it, and it's not returnable.  If you want to try an \"off-brand\" of K cup, try the San Franscisco Fog Chaser--it's not actually a K cup but fits into the Keurig and the coffee is good.  As far as the Brooklyn one, fuggetaboutit!"}
