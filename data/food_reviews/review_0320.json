They have eliminated the plastic lower portion of the package which has created a more enviromentally friendly product, although many who like to display their pods will be disappointed because you have to stick them in a zip lok bag after opening (boo hoo). If you open a traditional K-cup it looks exactly the same. Anyway, the coffee is amazing!! Bold but not overwhelming. Perfect for starting the day!<br /><br />Thanks for providing these Amazon!"}
