I didn't find any place I could find out what the ingredients were in this until after I got it and it tasted so weird.  I know, I should have checked it out first, but I didn't even suspect artificial ingredients would be a concern.  Anyway, it is non returnable but Amazon did refund my money for this because to us, it is not fit for consumption."}
