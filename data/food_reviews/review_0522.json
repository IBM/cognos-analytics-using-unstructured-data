Although we brew a big pot of coffee in the AM, shut the machine off, and use the microwave to heat cups later in the day, there are those days when we run out of coffee early, want another cup or two, and don't want to brew another whole pot.  These give us the additional cups of really good coffee we want - hate the usual instant stuff - and it's so quick and easy to make another cup this way.<br /><br />Great for camping too - and for making a cup of strong coffee when a recipe I'm using calls for one as an ingredient.  (I cook gluten-free - and can't make \"rye\" bread without a good strong cup of joe.)<br /><br />So glad I found it on Amazon.  They've gotten really expensive in the nearest Starbucks, and I'm already running out of the pack Santa put in my Christmas stocking.  Thanks, Amazon!"}
