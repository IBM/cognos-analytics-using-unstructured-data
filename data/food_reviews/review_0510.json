I often worry that the coffee may be old and have a wierd taste -- which has occurred twice. So, of course I was nervous about ordering this large amount online but said what the heck. It was a good choice. I do wish they would instant package the Breakfast Blend. That is my very favorite. Pike's Place is my next fav -- but not to be had in the instant variety either. This Columbian, medium roast, is quite tasty though. I'm having a cup right now and really enjoying it. Oh by the way, for the person who said the coffee is too strong and uses only half the package and the remainder of the coffee turns to goo. Tip: Do not pour the coffee into a cup of hot water. The steam from the water instantly makes the coffee hard to pour from the package and indeed starts to dissolve the coffee. Pour the coffee into the empty cup and then seal the package. A small paper clip works well."}
