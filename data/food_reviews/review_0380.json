I have the reusable cup and love it but was looking for the convenience of the pre-filled K-cups for workday mornings.<br /><br />These K-cups were exactly what I was looking for, convenience and delicious coffee! I prefer a bolder coffee and this Fog Chaser fit the bill. I also felt this was an excellent deal considering most K-cups retail for $10.00-$16.99 for a package of 12 K-cups (and sometimes 10) and this was 80 cups for just over $30.00. The other thing I love about this is being able to have it on the subscription program.  You can set up your delivery to be delivered whenever you like beginning with 1 month intervals and you get a small discount on the price when you order through a subscription. With a quantity of 80, I've set my deliveries to come every 4 months but it may turn out that I will have to shorten it to every three months.<br /><br />If you have a Kuerig and love the convenience of the pre-filled K-cups, you can't go wrong with this product. It is a bold coffee but this company makes several types that are available in several blends. I highly recommend this product and the added  value of the subscription option."}
