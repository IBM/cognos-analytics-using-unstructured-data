NO","text":"I bought this and Cyclone as I like Extra Bold.  Pre-Ordered without realizing they are \"clones\" of other products I already know are not my favorites, and BAD clones at that.  WAY TOO WEAK to bear the Extra Bold label.  Avoid these if you like your coffee strong!  Try Double Black Diamond."}
