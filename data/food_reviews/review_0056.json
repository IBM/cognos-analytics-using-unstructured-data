I have been buying the Walmart brand Peach Tea and it just doesn't come anywhere near the taste of this Lipton Tea. I was EXTREMELY stoked when I found out you can buy this through Amazon! This is my son and I's absolute favorite Peach Tea to drink! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!! Also the price is UNBEATABLE!!"}
