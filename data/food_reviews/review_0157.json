They're just not all that tasty, and all have a nasty aftertaste from the artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />This product almost earned itself a one-star review because in addition to the aftertaste, there are little crumbly bits in it that just aren't a pleasant thing to encounter in a beverage. It was a rather nasty experience overall, really, but it saved itself from one star because the actual fruit and green tea flavours were really quite nice."}
