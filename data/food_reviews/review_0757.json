The taste was somewhat medicinal with a bitter aftertaste. Not returnable at Amazon since it is opened and after exchanging emails with the company, Sturm Foods, Inc.,  I learned they do not refund customers based on \"personal taste\". I would suggest staying with a brand you know and love and avoid this \"bargain\" item."}
