I like a nice bold cup but that is smooth... this is it!  I always put<br />it on the 2nd cup setting (above the espresso size) for all of the K-cups for myself..<br />my husb puts it on the third setting.  I made this coffee first for my husband on the<br />3rd setting and took a sip .... YUMMMY!!!!!! It was PERFECT... bold and smooth! I was<br />so excited! My husband took a sip and loved it too!<br /><br />I am glad that I can have one good full cup on the third setting and not two cups of<br />Emeril's Bold (which I love too) or Green Mountain Italian Blend (which I LOVE too).<br /><br />I did have one cup where some grounds were found on the top of the coffee... I was like<br />\"Oh man... this is not good!!\"  I just took a paper towel and skimmed it and they came<br />right out and it hasn't happened since. And we've had about 8 cups of it all together.<br /><br />I'm thinking that maybe with these cups you really do need to line them up right? Prob<br />not... maybe just growing pains for these guys.<br /><br />Seems like a neat company and I will be buying the Cyclone again when we get close to<br />running out!<br /><br />Please keep the price the way it is...!<br /><br />Lisa"}
