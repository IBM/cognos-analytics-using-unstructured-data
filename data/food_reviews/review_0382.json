The best part though is the cup can be re-used. I have a K-cap <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053CEPP6\">My-Kap Green Reusable 3 Piece Cap Set for K-Cups</a> and I just clean out the cup and refill with whatever coffee I choose.  It's really the perfect design for re-use as the grounds dry out completely overnight and dump out very easily. I'm buying the whole bean San Francisco coffee to grind and refill the cup. The possibilities are endless!"}
