It had good flavor, but I am just not used to the amount of sugar it had in it and I add a half cup of regular coffee to it to tone it down.  I wish I had realized that it contained sugar and cream, if I had I think I would have chosen something different and been a lot happier with the purchase.  Kids should love this coffee drink though...."}
