Yes I can taste the hazelnut, but smell it more than taste it.  A small cup is way too sweet and the larger cup is weak.  It's so sticky sweet that I run a large cup of water through my maker to make sure it doesn't clog my machine up.  If you like the instant stuff you get from a machine at a convenience store then this is for you.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q37U\">Grove Square Cappuccino Cups, Hazelnut, Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>"}
