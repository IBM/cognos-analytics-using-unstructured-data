Did it really need so much?<br />I vote a resounding NO. Lipton at least didn't load this one up with aspartame, which is a shocker,<br />but they did use plenty of other sweeteners, then added SUCRALOSE too. Too much. Way too much.<br /><br />The honey adds a really pleasant smooth taste to the tea. Most of us at our house like pomegranate and<br />love blackberries, so thought how bad could it really be?  Answer - BAD.<br /><br />This tea is more like kool-aid than flavored tea.<br />The color is a medium pinkish red, not anything like tea and more like kool-aid.<br />The taste is overly fruity, with hardly any tea taste at all. We tried adding some<br />other instant plain tea to it, and it helped somewhat so the box was not a total loss.<br /><br />Would we buy it again?  Nope, not this one.<br />What could have been a healthy, refreshing tea drink ended up being more of a glass of kool-aid<br />instead. We'll pass."}
