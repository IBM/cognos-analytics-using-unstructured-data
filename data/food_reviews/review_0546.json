It will probably be a least 50 years, and I don't plan on being here in 50 years. So, when I took that first delicious sip of Starbucks Instant Italian Roast Coffee...it hit the Starbucks-craving spot. The flavor is so much better than any other instant coffee I've ever tasted. Here's the thing--it's still instant coffee. But, it actually tastes almost exactly like regular brewed coffee. It's an expensive cup of heaven...I'll be saving mine for special occasions. Because, in West Africa, you have to savor the luxurious moments in-between mosquito attacks and power cuts."}
