The added bonus of not paying what you would pay at a Starbucks for essentially the same thing is an even better way to start your day :)<br /><br />Flavor: rich, bold and full-bodied. I've had other kinds of instant before and although I do prefer to use my moka pot for coffee, this makes a REALLY nice alternative.<br /><br />This coffee leaves no lingering aftertaste, the aroma is incredible and the taste is fresh brewed. You can't beat that! I keep stashes of these at work and in my handbag. Mmmm!"}
