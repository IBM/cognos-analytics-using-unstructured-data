It has a rich flavor and doesn't taste like<br />instant. I gave it a 4 because of the cost and the packaging. It would be much more cost efficient if<br />it came in a jar, rather than individual packets. Also, each packet is too strong for one cup (for me)<br />so I use only 1/2 now and have to save the other half. Packets are great for traveling, but for home use<br />it's unnecessary."}
