This is a Very Nice Cappuccino / French Vanilla flavored drink.  It is well above what you find in some gas stations - and not as good as in some others.  Just because you get it in a gas station does not make it bad - go to Italy and find out.  This makes a very acceptable cup using the middle or lowest setting.
