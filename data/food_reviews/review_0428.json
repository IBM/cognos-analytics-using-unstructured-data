My husband makes our coffee each morning with our espresso machine.  It makes us happy.  But we have done alot of travel in the last six months.  We had a system of grinding our beans and doing a cup at a time with our coffee that we brought with us.  We ran out in the middle of not coffee country.  We did find a Starbucks and got some Via to tide us over.  It isn't the Americano my husband does for us at home, but it has become a good substitute when we are traveling.  Still love our own beans...but this is good.  Certainly not like any other instant I have tasted...much, much, much better."}
