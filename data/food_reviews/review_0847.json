Clearly not made by the same people who make \"real\" K-Cups. Beyond that the coffee is marginal at best, it is not strong and has the grainy taste that I normally associate with cheap diner coffee, not a good coffee flavor at all.<br /><br />This goes down as a lesson learned and an example of getting what you pay for. Back to the Big Box store for the Barista Prima Columbia, now that's a decent cup of coffee, I just wish Amazon carried it at a decent price.<br /><br />****UPDATE****<br /><br />The good folks at Brooklyn Bean sent me a replacement box and I thought it was worth an updated review. Initially I had tried the \"Fuhgeddaboudit\" blend as was not impressed. On their recommendation I tried the Cyclone and it is much more to my taste, I would happily brew it instead of my normal Barista Prima Columbia blend. On the basis of the flavor I would give it 5 stars, but this morning I had a \"filter blowout\" and wound up with grounds all over the counter, so I knocked a couple of stars off. That's one failure out of about 15 brews, and may be an isolated incident. I'll keep brewing and may well order more and will update my review to reflect any future failures."}
