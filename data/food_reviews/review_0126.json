The dilution eliminates the cloying sweetness of honey granules and sucralose, allowing the green tea powder and citric acid to bring the right amount of tartness to the mix.<br /><br />Lipton's new drink tastes better than <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4CCSQ\">MIO Liquid Peach Tea</a> and should please Crystal Light fans. Personally, I don't enjoy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9SS\">Crystal Light Green Tea Peach Mango Drink Mix</a> unless I find it as a fountain drink (again, the addition of crushed ice helps a bunch). Peach flavored instant tea is more common to find but I like Lipton's decision to pair mango and pineapple.<br /><br />Patience is important because the honey granules take additional time to break down into the water. Adding crushed ice helps blend the powder mix faster than with water alone.<br /><br />Lipton's box states that the drink is five calories per 8 oz serving with 60 mg tea flavonoids.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.<br /><br />BTW: Please be gentle with the video review. It was a family production. My 9-year old son, Kai, handled the filming and my 7-year son, Kou, was a taste tester."}
