Tastes like real coffee. Still not better than brewed, but hey.","text":"I have two positive reviews for this product -- me as a coffee drinker, and after polling a number of training participants at my work after switching 100% to via products.<br /><br />I drink very dark french press coffee at home, and often espresso. I am very picky about my coffee. So, for me to find this instant coffee very drinkable is quite impressive. I like the italian roast, and can't really drink the medium roast. I drink this at work when I have trainings, and think it's pretty close to the real thing, but still not the same as getting a fresh brewed cup. However, in a pinch, it's a great substitute. My husband likes the Via so that he doesn't have to make noise making coffee in the morning at home -- we have a 3 month old son -- and grinding and boiling water can get loud.<br /><br />I work in a business where we previously had a caterer bringing us coffee (very subpar) and it was costing us $20-50 per class. Now people are impressed that the Starbucks Via is out. They seem to like the coffee (all flavors) and say it's an improvement over the catering coffee. And, we are saving SO much money because people only consume what they need, rather than paying per person with a caterer. A win-win! Thanks for making it taste good, Starbucks!"}
