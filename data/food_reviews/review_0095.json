Blackberry/Pomegranate is a fantastic combo and using Sucralose instead of Aspartame (which metabolizes into formaldehyde) makes it that much better! Some might find it a little too sweet, but I liked it fine.  And being a Type II Diabetic I'm very happy to have something that I can enjoy pretty much whenever I want and won't throw my diet out of whack.  Nice job, Lipton."}
