I first tried it when we went on vacation and I was frustrated w/ the lack of good hotel coffee (the strong stuff!).  This is very convenient to carry anywhere.  I also make iced coffee w/ it and sometimes add chocolate syrup for a mocha coffee.  This is the real deal, very strong, and not artificial.  Bring it wherever you need it!"}
