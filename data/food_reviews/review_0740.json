Is it a chemical abomination? You bet! Does it taste great with a day-old buttered roll in a wax-paper sleeve? Absolutely! Here is the real thing that fogs your windows and leaves a vanilla aroma in its aftermath. It is sickeningly sweet and guaranteed to snap you out of a hangover when followed with a day-old roll or bagel with cream cheese. Nothing short of an American classic and friend of the open road.<br /><br />It's not just about the sugar. They actually put 30mg of caffeine into this concoction of--well, you really don't need to know.<br /><br />It's cheaper than the $1.75 at the gas station (around $.45 a paper cup).<br /><br />It's not actually coffee-- but it hits the spot when you're down and out and need something more for breakfast than a Baby Ruth Bar.<br /><br />Go ahead- you know that you want this, uh...whatever it is. Mmmmm! Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!"}
