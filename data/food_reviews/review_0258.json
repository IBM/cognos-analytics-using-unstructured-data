It is incredibly good, I don't think I want a cup of coffee and then I remember these are in the carousel for my Keurig machine, I change my mind in a heartbeat. It's like having a box of your favorite snack in the cupboard and trying to resist eating it, but you know it's there and you keep thinking about it.<br /><br />The flavor of this San Fransisco Bay coffee is rich, complex, and delicious. I can't think of a cup of coffee that I've bought anywhere that can beat the bold, rich flavor of this brand. It's like drinking a glass of fine wine. My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder. I'm torn on this, I 'think' I'd rather have the pods be the more usual plastic in order to preserve freshness, but time will tell. I doubt any of the pods I have will have time to ever get stale however, because I'm drinking them all the time."}
