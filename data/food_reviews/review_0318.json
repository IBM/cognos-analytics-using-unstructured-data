It reminded me a lot of the coffee I sometimes have to have when the family all wants to stop at Mcdonalds for breakfast. I also found that the coffee pods/K-cup quickly lost its freshness after two days. I had it inside an air tight container but soon after a couple of days the freshness was gone and the aroma of the coffee smelled like the can of Folgers that my mother-in-law has on her shelf. They also make a french roast which I thought was OK. But again, a bit weak for a french roast coffee. The french roast coffee, as was with the fog chaser,after a couple of days, soon lost its flavor and the aroma became \"Folgers coffee\" like. I guess the packaging makes a difference. In conclusion, I do not think I will be purchasing this again."}
