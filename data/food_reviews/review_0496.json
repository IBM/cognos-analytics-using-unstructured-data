This one however was much weaker and only one in a cup was too weak. So I used two packets for one cup, and when you figure the unit cost, that's about $1.25/cup for instant. Also, when you open the package, the coffee really doesn't seem to flow smoothly and often I would get some on the counter.<br /><br />Not planning to purchase again."}
