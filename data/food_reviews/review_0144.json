Malic acid, maltodextrin, and sucralose are pretty much the only things my tongue registered. I think you'd have to be a professional food taster with an incredibly refined set of taste buds to recognize any hint of green tea or honey.<br /><br />What i really can't grasp is why they bothered putting any real sugar in this in the first place. Why not make it 0 calorie and skip the sugar entirely, instead of putting the 10 calories (per packet, which is two servings, hence 'only 5 calories per serving!') in with no effect whatsoever on the taste of the product.<br /><br />And worse yet, if they're going to grossly oversweeten it, why not use a zero-calorie sweetener like stevia that doesn't taste like a chemical factory exploded on your tongue?<br /><br />People who consume enough fake sugar that they've lost the negative reaction to the chemical aftertaste of those products will probably find this product pleasantly sweet and fruity. Everyone else, well, just don't buy this."}
