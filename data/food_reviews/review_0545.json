One pack of the Italian roast can still make a pretty good 16oz cup of coffee. It's better as 8oz - 12oz but you can get away with 16oz. I tried the Taster's Choice and regretted it. The Taster's Choice is half the price but you need at least 3 TC's packs to equal 1 VIA and it's still not that good. Spend the extra couple of dollars on Starbucks. You know it's worth it."}
