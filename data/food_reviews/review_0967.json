The k-cups themselves, however, have a tendency to explode, leaving a watery, coffeee-ground laden mess everywhere. The problem is the plastic on the bottom of the cup, it's either too thick, or a different material from most other k-cups. When you close the machine, the needle that is supposed to pierce the bottom of the cup sometimes fails to pierce the cup, but rather causes it to indent. The top needle has no problem piercing the top foil. The result is similar to trying to rinse the left over peanut butter out of a measuring spoon by putting it under the faucet running full blast. There is an easy way to prevent this from happening - if you manually push down the k-cup when you put it in the machine and make sure you feel the pop of the needle piercing the cup, you won't have any problems.<br /><br />That being said, the coffee is very good - will buy again."}
