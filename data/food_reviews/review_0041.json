I tend to prefer plain/lemon teas to other fruit types, however, but I still decided to give this product a try, as I liked the idea that the tea is sweetened only with honey (i.e., no artificial sweeteners).  According to the packaging, each 8 oz. serving has 5 calories and 10 m.g. of caffeine.<br /><br />I really love the convenience of the little individual packets!  They are easy to tear open, and you could toss one in your bag/purse or bring them to work (which is what I did).  The dry crystals dissolve nicely in water.  For my own tastes, the tea was a bit too fruity--although it didn't taste like fruit punch (which is what I don't like about some fruit-flavored teas), you can definitely taste both the berry and pomegranate flavors.  However, I could also discern a tea taste as well as a touch of honey.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good product, and I would definitely recommended it to those who enjoy fruit teas."}
