I like that there's less waste to dump in landfills. However, the pods don't work well in my Keurig. In order to brew, I have to push down on the handle until the cycle is done, otherwise, nothing happens. I really like the flavor of the coffee, but keeping it fresh is an issue, even though I store the pods in air-tight containers. I probably won't buy coffee packaged this way in the future."}
