You can actually see coffee residue embedded in the top of the K-cups, and most brews result in considerable grounds in the cup.  I have never had this issue with any other K-cup brands.  And worst of all, the coffee tastes as if the roaster simply filled it up with stale Folgers. And be aware that Amazon does not accept returns on K-cups."}
