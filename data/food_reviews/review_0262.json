Great price.","text":"I am one of those guys that dont like the rising price of k cups. This works great and makes a pretty good<br />cup of coffee. It is very easy to clean up.. just throw away. At the current price of 16.99 it is about .47<br />per cup or .40 with subscribe and safe. I also like saving money using the EKOBREW the refillable k cup filter, when you use that you can put in your own grinds and it costs about .25 for starbucks. This is a little easier when you are finished though and is a Good Value."}
