I actually like to start my day off with their French Roast or one of their other dark roasts but the Corner Donut Shop is my \"go to\" variety throughout the day.<br /><br />Not only does the coffee taste great but it is a fun brand.  Someone has been super creative in the naming of the varieties.  \"Anybody want a Brooklyn Bridge?\" is my favorite line.  I keep most of the varieties in my office as they are a favorite of many."}
