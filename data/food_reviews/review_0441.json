I decided to give it a try. VIA coffee has a full flavor compared to other instant coffees, but it still isn't as good as a fresh cuppajoe. I love the convenience of these packages, since in my job, I don't always have time to go and find a cup of coffee. I can pour bottled water into my mug, pop it in the nuker, and then just pour the package into the steaming water. It also seems to be stronger than typical coffee, as far as the caffeine. All in all, I feel like I made a good choice. If I were you, and you were me, we'd be each other, and you'd know how I feel about the VIA coffee. I should mention here that I am NOT a huge fan of Starbucks coffee in general, but I was impressed with VIA. ONE COMPLAINT... the package. When you open the package, the opening is so narrow, that when you try to pour it into your steaming water, the steam makes the coffee powder get all sticky and clogs the opening. Other than that, I'm pretty happy with VIA. (But I'd rather have a nice fresh cup of french-press... or Dutch-press =))"}
