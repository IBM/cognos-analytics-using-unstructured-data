This product needs diluted.","text":"First I want to say that one packet is way too much for 8oz of water. I used 2 packets with 2-quarts of water and this brings a nice, light flavor that does not taste artificial. Using one packet in a bottle of water would make me choke.<br /><br />Second, don't put these packets into your purse or bag.  The starter cut that allows for easy opening of the package is too deep.  I had taken the box to work with me.  When I realized I needed to mix the powder in greater quantity, I put three packets into my work bag.  Between leaving the office and arriving home (with the majority of the trip the bag sat on the passenger seat of my car), all three were open and I had powder everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, the powder does not completely dissolve, even mixing with more water.  It could be that vigorous shaking of the product in a water bottle would help dissolve better than a spoon in a glass pitcher, but I would expect it to eventually dissolve either way, and this is not the case.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is good but only if you dilute it tremendously.  I was reading another review regarding the sweeteners and there are some excellent points to contemplate in that review.  I'm not even going to discuss what is on the label.  I'm just basing my opinion off my direct experience.<br /><br />My rating is a 3-star.  Had I used as directed, it would probably be a 1-star."}
