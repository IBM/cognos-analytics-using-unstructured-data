Many of us who really prefer a good cuppa in the morning (or noon, or night) often buy our own supply now. I really love having a lower cost alternative that gives me the great taste I want. The ones I've tried so far have been delicious and they work perfectly. I've seen a few reviews about faulty cups, but I haven't seen anything of the kind."}
