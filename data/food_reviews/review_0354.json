They are probably the worst k cups ever. The taste is terrible. I tried both the fog chaser and rainforest blend. They both taste awful, like bark and dirt. There is dark brown \"sediment\" left in the bottom of the cup when you drink this brand. I find that the taste is strong in the dirt department, but highly lacking in the coffee flavor area. I will never buy these again. I like my coffee in the morning, but I actually dread having to use these if there is nothing else available."}
