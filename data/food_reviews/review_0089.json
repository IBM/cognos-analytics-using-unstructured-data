I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. There is 2gm sugar, 10 calories and 2gm of carbs per packet (it is listed as 1/2 packet per serving, but that is unrealistic). One packet makes about 16oz prepared. Each box comes with 10 packets. The packets are made with real tea leaves and each packet (2 servings) contains 120mg tea flavonoids.<br /><br />My first impression of this drink mix was something along the lines of \"ohh my...\" followed by a second quick drink. This stuff is WAY better than I thought it would be. I think I would actually prefer the taste of the Lipton Tea & Honey Blackberry Pomegranate to fresh brewed Blackberry pomegranate tea with honey. It is incredible! The honey sweetens it perfectly without giving it that over-sweet, bitter taste. The tea itself tastes more like a black tea than a green tea (which is a good thing in my book because black tea tastes better, but green tea seems to have more health benefits). It has a perfect harmonious balance between the blackberry, pomegranate and honey. They seem to compliment each other very well.<br /><br />This was my first time trying any of the Lipton Tea&Honey packets and I am tempted to run out (in pajamas and all) and snatch the rest of them off of the grocery shelf because I have a new favorite. Thanks Vine for bringing these into my life. I definitely recommend you try this....NOW.<br /><br />Note: all tastes buds are different and mine do tend to prefer super sweet drinks, so these may be too sweet for you if you like light sweetening. However, you can always add more water to your cup! I think you should try them and decide for yourself"}
