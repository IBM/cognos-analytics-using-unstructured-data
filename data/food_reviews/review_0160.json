Overly sweet, this is more like honey-mango-pineapple Kool-aide. Almost sickly-sweet, the green tea aspect is totally lost. And what's more, it is grainy and difficult to completely dissolve, resisting even the most vigorous stirring spoon. Two stars only because my four-year-old kind of likes it."}
