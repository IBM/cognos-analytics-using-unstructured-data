My box contained two cups that had leaked grounds.  First two in the brewer were spectacular blow outs, the next two dumped ground into the cups.  I've contacted BBR for replacements, let's see how that works out.<br /><br />Edit:  I should point out that I rather enjoy the coffee itself.  Since I have one of the Keurig inserts for brewing your own grounds, it's a matter of opening the BBR package and dumping in the contents.  The coffe has that strong taste to it that reminds me of coffe thats been brewing all day.  Similar to Coffee People Jet Fuel, I'd choose this over Jet Fuel if it weren't for the packaging issues.<br /><br />Fix the issues and the review would be a 4."}
