Merely diluting the mixture really diminishes the tea flavor.  Many of you will not m ind the sweetness, but I believe that the the tea flavor sbould be present.<br /><br />The only fix is to use unflavored Lipton tea, or any herbal tea mix with each packet of flavoSa.<br /><br />Sucralose is the artificial sweeetener thatgives this drink its icky-sweetness.It is allegedly safe as aspartame; and it is definitely OK for use by diabetics.  However, there are disturbing cases of neurological side effects by even casual use of Sucralose.  Those persons suspicious of aspartame might want to avoid sucrlose as well."}
