She told me that she thought I would like them, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />She was right! I absolutely loved these, and after running out of the samples decided to order some from Amazon.<br /><br />For me, they were the perfect ammount of sweetness, and I didn't find there to be any weird artificial sweetner taste as some other reviwers have mentioned.<br /><br />Now I drink one of these every day. The only thing I prefer over these are the Caramel flavored ones (also from Grove Square).<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to everyone. Especially people who normally don't like coffee. A+ and 5 stars in my book!"}
