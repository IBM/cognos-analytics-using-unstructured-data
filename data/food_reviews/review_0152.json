I like blackberries and pomegrantes.  This flavor stick leaves an aftertaste in my mouth that I didn't like very much.  I have had some better tasting flavors (see my review for the Lipton strawberry flavor).  I really couldn't get past the after taste.  I probably will not be getting this flavor again."}
