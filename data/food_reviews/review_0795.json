Some reviewers compare this to gas station machine cappuccino but I have had way better \"cappuccinos\" from gas station machines than this.<br /><br />Edit (10/9/2012) : I now see a ton of 5 star reviews in the last month or two for this trash! The surprise is that all of them are \"Amazon Verified Purchase\" and most of them are the only review the purchaser has written. If this isn't a case of cooked up reviews, I don't know what is!!"}
