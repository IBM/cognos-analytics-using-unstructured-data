BUT THEY CAME UP WITH THE LOUSY ELONGATED AND SKINNY PACKETS. THEY ARE HARD TO HOLD, DIFFICULT TO EASILY OPEN AND WHEN YOU HAVE HOT WATER IN A CUP--THE STEAM CLOGS THE NARROW OPENING OF THE PACKET MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO POUR IN YOUR CUP.. WHY CANT STARBUCKS PUT IT INTO A WIDE PACKET LIKE EQUAL OR SWEET AND LOW? GREAT PRODUCT--DUMB PACKAGING."}
