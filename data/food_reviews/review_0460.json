I bought this because I have a hot water pot and sometimes am too in a hurry to brew.  I thought this would be a good 2nd option.  However, the taste is just funny.  There is something to this coffee that is similar to other instant coffees.  There is only a hint of that Starbucks goodness IMHO.  In no way is this product comparable to a Starbuck brewed coffee either at home or at an outlet.  I cannot recommend it.<br /><br />FYI:  purchased 12/26/11, expires 04/2012."}
