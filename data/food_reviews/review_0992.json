I liked this coffees flavor and the aroma a lot! It had my whole kitchen scented delicious (which is rare with a k cup and is one of the only things I miss about more traditional brewing).  The only down fall was that there was loose grinds in the packaging and they seemed to leak a little during brewing.  Maybe I am not as picky as others, but the flavor & cost far outweighed that small leakage."}
