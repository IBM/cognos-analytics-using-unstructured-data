With such an attractive price I finally decided to give San Francisco Bay's Fog Chaser a chance. I was a little worried about the unique design of these cups. However, after receiving them and brewing a couple of cups of coffee I can say that there was no need to worry. I would describe this coffee as Medium roast, maybe leaning towards dark. It has a nice distinctive flavor, and the Amazon Frustration Free packaging really is frustration free. We store our open cups in a sealed container to help maintain freshness. All in all a good cup of coffee, and as long as the price remains competitive I will be a repeat customer."}
