Almost every time that I brew this in my Keurig brewer there are grounds in my coffee. Sometimes the bottom doesn't punture and the k-cup flows over and at other times it does but there are still grounds. I have had to brew two cups usually to get one cup of coffee. My other brands don't have this problem. I gave it one star because when I do get a decent cup it tastes OK."}
