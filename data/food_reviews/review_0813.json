As noted here by many reviewers, some of the K-cups seem to \"explode\" and dump coffee grounds into your cup of joe.  Not good! I contacted their customer service and they were very apologetic and admitted to a quality control problem with some of their early run k-cups.  They quickly sent out a replacement box - and in addition - a second box of Corner Donut Shop. We have had no problems at all with these and I am very pleased with the taste of the Donut Shop blend as it is more bold than the Brooklyn Bridge (which my wife prefers).  We will definitely be ordering more. They acknowledged  the problem and made it right immediately.  Too bad that seems to be the exception to the rule these days in customer service. All in all a great deal on this coffee through Amazon subscribe and save."}
