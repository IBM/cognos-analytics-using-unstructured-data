It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused \"k-cups\" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.  I like to have variety in the morning whether it be Jet Fuel or Italian roast according to how I feel that day so these won't be purchased by me again."}
