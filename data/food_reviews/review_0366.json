Breakfast blend is still the best.  All flavors have plenty of flavor for a 16oz travel mug. (If you don't have the larger cup size on your machine, brew at the small cup setting and lift the handle and brew again) Can't beat the value especially if you get them via Amazon subscription.  Hey Amazon when are you going to sell these in the 80 pack?"}
