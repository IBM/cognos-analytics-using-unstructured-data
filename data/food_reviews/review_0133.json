I tested the Blackberry Pomegranate.<br /><br />Summary:  If you like your iced tea to be very sweet, and you want a diet version, you will probably like this.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Low calorie: only 5 calories.<br />- Taste: Hint of honey up front and a mild green tea flavor coupled with fruit.<br />- Portable:  One small packet makes 16oz<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Very sweet.  This is personal preference.  If you like your iced tea very sweet, you'll probably like this.  I personally like about half the sweetener.  I'm not sure why diet drink makers feel the need to make their artificially-sweetened drinks so sweet.  The main flavor I taste here is the splenda sweetener.<br />- Dissolves slow.  After 60 seconds of stirring there were still a couple of clumps."}
