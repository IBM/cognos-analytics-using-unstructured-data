As with all of the other K-cup coffees I've purchased, I expected it to be filled with coffee for my Keurig to BREW.  Unfortunately, it is filled with instant coffee and flavored with creamer and sweetners.  It tastes HORRIBLE.  I'm pitching the rest -it's not even worth donating to our church.  If I'd wanted Sanka, I would not have purchased an expensive coffee brewer - the microwave would have been good enough!  What I WANT is a cup of freshly brewed coffee.  The product description did not disclose the fact that it is fake coffee.  If a real cup of freshly brewed coffee is what you want from your Keurig brewer, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"}
