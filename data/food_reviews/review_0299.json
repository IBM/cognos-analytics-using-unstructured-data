It's really delicious coffee -- bold and flavorful, without the mouth-puckering acidity of some of the coffee I've tried.  The flavor changes as it cools, too.  Most delightful.<br /><br />However.  The first time I used one it really made a mess.  I had to clean coffee grounds out of the brewing doohickey on the Keurig (which I hate doing because it's tedious), and there was quite a bit of sediment in my cup, too.  It's exactly the same thing that happens with my reusable k-cup.  I was trying to find an alternative to that, and to contributing so many of those little plastic planet-polluter K-cups to the landfill.  (We drink a lot of coffee.)<br /><br />If the company could find a way to keep that from happening -- a coarser grind, maybe? -- I'd for sure try this again.  I can use the remaining pods, though. They'll be handy for traveling with. I tried opening one and brewing the coffee in my Aeropress and they're just right for that.<br /><br />And then, later on...<br />I had to come back and update this review.  We ran out of Kcups, and I dug these out of the cupboard in desperation.  My husband likes them so much that I'm ordering more, messy or not.  BTW, he said he considers the sediment minimal, and not much of an issue at all."}
