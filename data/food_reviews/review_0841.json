I was looking for reasonable k-cups, but this is not an item I'd purchase again even at a lower price.<br /><br />I was IMPRESSED with Brooklyn Bean Roastery's response!  They sent an order of Cyclone at no cost...and it was a full order not a 6-10 kcup sample!  They followed up to see if I was happy with Cyclone.<br /><br />Cyclone was very good and I'll order more.  The cups have brewed perfectly each time.  I've seen some comments that weren't positive, but the company seems to be working hard and it's worth trying."}
