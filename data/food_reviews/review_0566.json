Being a chocoholic, I combine it with a \"low\"-calorie instant cocoa to make myself a mocha.  (So I order decaf to \"offset\" the extra caffeine from the cocoa &lt;grin>.)<br /><br />While the product on the first shipment had an early (as in about 4-5 months) expiration date, that has not since been the case.  (The early expiration date didn't matter at the time since I went through the product within a couple of months.)  In fact, I have 8-9 months before the expiration date on the latest shipment, which is good because I stocked up on the caffeinated version when it went on \"sale\" at Costco before the holidays.<br /><br />An unexpected bonus in this latest shipment was a sample of Blonde Veranda Blend.  Cool!  (I don't have an automatic drip coffee maker so I need to dig out my Keurig filter basket to try the coffee.  But I'm looking forward to it.)"}
