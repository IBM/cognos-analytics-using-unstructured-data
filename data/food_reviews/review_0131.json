The positive is this Lipton Green Tea in Honey, Mango Pineapple flavor is true to taste, offering a real sweet combination of the three flavors.  The negative is that I just couldn't get past the disinct aftertaste from the sucralose additive.  I've tried other lo cal drink mixes, and all basically offer the same flavors with artificial sweeteners to save on the calories.  So unless you enjoy that metallic after-flavor with your drink, pass these up and go with plain and refreshing water or sparkling seltzer."}
