I bought one box to try it out and have had no problems what-so-ever. All of the pods in the box were sealed so I didn't have that issue that others complain about. Some of the pods are \"puffy\", but that also happens with other brands of Keurig Coffees - you simply put it into the machine and push it down firmly before closing the lid. This forces out the air and prevents short cupping and clogging the filter. The coffee is delicious, it smells great and for the price I'm very pleased with it. We have the Cuisinart Machine, not the Keurig branded machine, which may be part of the reason. We had alot of problems with our Keurig Platinum machine and had to replace it twice. That machine is poorly made and alot of the problems I've read about in the other reviews are symptomatic of that machine, not just poorly packaged coffee. I'll buy this stuff again."}
