The donut shop coffee tastes great the cyclone is ok but that is when the pods work. The over flow out the top and grounds in my coffee and the needle clogging up is a real inconvienece though. The other thing is about 1/4 of the pods in the box of cyclone I bought had the top seal partially open and coffee grounds were spilling out. I love k cups but these k cups aren't working right so keep that in mind when you make your next coffee decision. If they fix the problem and guarantee it will not happen again I would gladly buy their coffee."}
