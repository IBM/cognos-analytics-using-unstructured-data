They jam up the Keurig coffee maker and overflow causing it to spill out over and as a result give you about a third of a mug of coffee filled with grounds. I am 100 percent disappointed. I will never buy this coffee again. This is the only k cups that has this problem. I have used many other varieties and none have caused me these problems. Wish I could have a refund.<br /><br />Brooklyn coffees has not only sent me a replacement and another free box besides but this time the k cups appear to work like they should. Thank you Brooklyn Bean Roastery."}
