This cappucinno is absolutely delicious!!!! It tastes just like what I buy every morning at the gas station on my way to work...ONLY IT IS MUCH CHEAPER!!! It's also more convenient now that I can make it at home and not have to stop at the station to buy it! Makes my day a little smoother and I don't have to rush!<br />Yes, this K-cup is instant coffee, but so's the stuff I buy from the machine at the gas station! I love it! I love the price! I love the taste! I will make sure to keep this in stock at my house...especially if the price stays low!"}
