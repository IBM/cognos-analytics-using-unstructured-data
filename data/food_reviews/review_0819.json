My review is on the flavor of this coffee. The description claim is that it is a \"Flavor match to Coffee People Jet Fuel. Tasty, full-bodied, smoky blend.\" This stuff tastes nothing like Jet Fuel. Even though the \"best by\" date on the box is 02/13 this stuff tastes old and stale to me. Unfortunately I bought two boxes so I'll muddle through, but then I'll be going back to either Jet Fuel or Black Tiger. If you're a fan of either one of those, fuhgeddabout Fuhgeddaboutit and stick with your fav."}
