I went by other peoples reviews when I purchased this coffee. The coffee was rated good by everyone so I took my chances and ordered it. My boyfriend and I both tried it and it was not drinkable! The taste and the smell of it was terrible! I didn't even feel I could give them away to anyone because I didn't want to subject anyone else to the terrible taste of it, so I tossed them in the garbage. What a waste of money! I will stick with familiar brands like Green Mountain."}
