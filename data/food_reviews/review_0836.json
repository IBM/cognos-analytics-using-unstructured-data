We tried the Brooklyn Bridge Blend.<br /><br />Usually, I have to put a lot of sugar in my coffee because I think its too bitter, but this tasted mild, (not weak)  just... a pleasant coffee flavor without being too strong for me and I was able to cut out some sugar, which is always nice.<br /><br />I had one cup with a few grinds floating on top, but I've had that with almost every other brand I've had also, so I'm not concerned.<br /><br />I'd buy this even if it was the same price as other K-Cups, because my husband got such a kick out of the name and label, and of course, we both enjoyed the coffee, but the fact that its cheaper than other brands is great too."}
