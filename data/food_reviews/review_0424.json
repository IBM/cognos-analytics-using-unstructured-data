I use one via packet and mix with a little water and milk. then add sugar and add in some monin dark chocolate or monin caramel around the cup, followed by some ice and topped with whipped cream. My caramel or mocha iced coffee is quick and easy to make, and tastes better than starbucks or mcdonalds, and is cheaper and more convenient!!!"}
