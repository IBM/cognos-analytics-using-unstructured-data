This, Lipton Iced Green Tea mix, is similar in the fact that it comes in a box of 10 packets, each ready to mix into a 16.9 oz. bottle of water or a like-sized glass of water.  I used it in a glass, stirring with a spoon, and it dissolved quickly for me.  I found it to be quite strong even with added ice, and ended up adding more cold water to suit my taste. I thought the flavor was good.  I could taste the honey, blackberry, and pomegranate flavors but found it was a bit overly sweet, and this comes from a confessed sugar junkie. Still, I enjoyed it after adding the water and would choose it again.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, a serving is only 8 ounces, though you mix each packet in a 16~oz. bottle of water.  I can't imagine what the purpose of making this distinction is, other than to qualify the \"5 calories per serving\" claim on the front of the box.  Would 10 calories a serving be a deal breaker for most people?<br /><br />There are no other noted nutrition values besides 1 gram of sugar and 10 mg of caffeine per serving.  It states that each 8 ounce serving contains 60 milligrams of flavonoids, which is more than cranberry juice and almost twice that in orange juice.  From an internet reference, \"Flavonoids have antioxidant activity. Flavonoids are becoming very popular because they have many health promoting effects. Tea flavonoids have many health benefits. Tea flavonoids reduce the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein, lowers the blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.\"<br /><br />To summarize, I enjoyed this drink and would purchase it again.  It is convenient, tasty, and provides a few health benefits."}
