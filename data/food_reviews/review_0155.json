My fault I guess for not reading the reviews and just going by the Lipton description: \"sweetened with honey\". Sucralose ... \"Splenda\" is the actual sweetener NOT honey. The sickening artificial taste ruins what could have been a lovely product. Splenda is not a natural product, has no relation to honey and along with other reviews - also gives me fierce migraines. For an added kick, these are not available for returns. Shame on Lipton! Last Lipton product I will ever buy!"}
