The swill that they're serving now is an abomination to coffee, so I finally went out and bought a pack of these 50 Starbucks Via Italian Roast instant coffee.  Starbucks Via is pretty good, I mean, it's really good for instant coffee.  I am fortunate at work we have a hot-water maker thing that works well and gives you piping hot water, which dissolves this coffee dust in a matter of seconds... barely requiring a stir.<br /><br />THe coffee is strong and tastes similar to the Starbucks Italian Roast you might get from the store;  not the same, not as robust, not as \"burnt\" (something that I personally prefer), but still pretty damn good for instant coffee.<br /><br />Having irregular sleep patterns, this coffee has spared me the embarrassment of falling asleep in countless meetings.  It works, it tastes good, it holds cream well.  Only drawback is it leaves this muddy residue on the bottom of your cup.  But, that ain't all that bad.  It's not Sanka."}
