There's no longer a need to use my espresso machine or wait in line at my local Starbucks. The taste of the coffee is consistent with the bold Italian Roast coffee, and its equivalent to 'tall' size. Remember to use enough hot water and mix thoroughly, I had a few issues with grainy texture. Add to the bottom of the travel mug and pour boiling water over."}
