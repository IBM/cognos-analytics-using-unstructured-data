I assume this is to save money and reduce plastic.  It works fine in all K-cup brewers that I've tried.<br /><br />The coffee itself is really good.  It has a very bold taste but not too bitter.  Tastes much better with some cream and sugar.<br /><br />I ended up subscribing to these because I like them so much.  Definitely worth a try for coffee drinkers.  I only give items 5 stars if they far exceed expectations, so this gets 4 stars."}
