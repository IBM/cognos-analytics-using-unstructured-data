I am really happy with Fog Chaser. I've bounced around through all the Keurig dark roasts and in my opinion, this is better than all of them. The aroma and taste far surpass any K-cup I've ever had. I store the coffee in an air-tight container, and have had no problems with freshness. They work perfectly in my B70 brewer, and I do wash the K-cup holder every couple of days or so because these have a real filter instead of plastic. The price is great, especially with Subscribe and Save - never going back to plastic K-Cups!"}
