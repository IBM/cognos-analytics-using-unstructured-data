I liked the price and thought about how nice it would be to finally get a serious French Roast for my Keurig. Unfortunately this one did not measure up in the strength of flavor dept. I may try some of their other coffees though because I liked everything else about them very much. I just need my French Roast to have more punch than this one.<br /><br />***** price<br />***** fast shipping<br />**  French Roast flavor<br /><br />Sorry guys but I'll stick with Midnight Magic and Jet Fuel for now.<br /><br />Please some show me a reasonably priced French Roast K cup that actually tastes like a French Roast."}
