After hearing about their facebook page, I tried their sample box.  I was truly amazed that a company that, quite honestly, I had never heard of before made such an amazing brew.  The Brooklyn Bridge blend was really smooth.  The French Roast was full flavored, but my favorite was Fuhgeddboutit.  I'm a fan of strong coffee.  If you need a coffee that will not only taste really really good but wake you up, grab a box of Fuhgeddboutit.  That will kick your @$$!!.  I am truly pleased that I found them, and will continue to drink their coffee regularly!"}
