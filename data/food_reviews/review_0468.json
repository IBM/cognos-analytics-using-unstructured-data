Tastes like fresh-brewed Starbucks... hot or iced... so convenient","text":"PIcked it up after tasting it in the store, and have been enjoying it all week.  Cannot be any easier -- no cleaning the coffee machine anymore, yeaaaah!  Hot water, dump it in, and mmmm.... and I normally HATE any instant coffee.  This is unlike any instant I've tried, and really does taste as good as Starbucks in the store.  The best part is that you don't need hot water... you can add cold water and ice for an awesome iced coffee.  Am going to try the decaf bc I'm obviously drinking a lot more coffee now that I've discovered this."}
