Some of the flavored K-cups are just that - flavored coffee - and you need to add your own cream or milk and sweeteners.  But this is all ready the minute it stops brewing!  To me - the entire concept of the Keurig is to have your favorite beverage ready instantly.  If you have to fill little cups and add your own filters or add your own cream and sugar and flavoring - it isn't quick and instant - and you might as well go back to brewing an enitire pot of coffee or use the espresso machine.  K-cups for the Keurig makes it instant - and with this Vanilla Cappuccino - its ready right away - no need to add another thing.  AND - this is the ONLY place we've found that carries this product.  I've looked at every store in our area that carries K-cups and no one carries this.  Also - the price is great.  Especially this time around.  This is the 3rd time I've placed an order for these and the price was the best ever - $8.47 I think - for 24.  Great price!  Usually they are are betwween $10.47 and $12.  My only regret - I wish Grove Square would also make a Mocha K-cup.  That is another of our favorite coffee drinks."}
