It worked just fine.  Only problem is, they don't fit in my K-cup carousel all that well and tend to fall out if I turn it too fast.  Beyond that, the coffee tastes just fine and I LOVE the aroma in the kitchen.  Since they have a kind of mesh/fabric back, the aroma of the coffee comes through.  I HAD to have a cup as soon as they arrived just 'cauze it smelled so good!"}
