Some, such as \"Mio\" Sweet Tea and \"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch\" are pretty good for what they are. However, most are just either bland or too artificial-tasting for my palate. Unfortunately, \"Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate\", falls into the latter category, somehow managing to taste bland and artificial-tasting, all in one felled swoop.<br /><br />In all, there are far better drink alternatives out there. Avoid."}
