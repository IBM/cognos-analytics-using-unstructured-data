These are the small packages that you can take on the go and mix in water bottles; the 16-ounce bottles of water is what is recommended. I'm on a plan that was set up by my Nutritionist and in this plan, sugar is a big no-no. This drink is perfect because it has an artificial sweetner in, that's close to splenda, and there's no aftertaste. For a drink with artificial sweetner, the taste is great! This is a real good sweet tea substitute and I'm glad that I decided to try it."}
