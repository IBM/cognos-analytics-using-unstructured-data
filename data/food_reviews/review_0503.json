I just bought a pack of 50 Columbia Vias from Amazon and the best before date is 9 months from now!  I will definitely finish 50 by then!  I have bought these before from Amazon (and Starbucks stores) and they are great!  They arrived in an oversize retail style box with a dispensing hatch at the bottom... very convenient."}
