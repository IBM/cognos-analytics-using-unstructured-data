The first ingredient listed on the box is group of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.  Doesn't bode well for a supposed cappuccino.  That's followed by multiple, seemingly random sweeteners, then instant coffee, a long list of other stuff that has no business associating itself with coffee, and then (inexplicably) sucralose, which gives it a strong artificially bitter aftertaste.  I took 2 sips about 45 min ago, and still can't get the taste out of my mouth.  Definitely avoid."}
