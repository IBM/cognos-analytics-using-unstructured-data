If anything, these are probably a bit more environmentally-friendly than standard K-Cups simply by virtue of containing far less plastic.<br /><br />The only problem is, they just don't taste that good.  The coffee itself leaves something to be desired, surprising considering the history of the company that makes these. (full disclosure: I worked briefly for these folks back in the late '70s. Since I have a personal connection to the products, I really wanted to like them) I liked this better than the Rainforest Blend (which I found weak and watery) but not as much as the French Roast. (which I didn't really care for that much when I first tasted it, but found it grew on me as I worked my way through the case and compared it with other K-Cups)<br /><br />Keep in mind that this review is based on a single cup, and I didn't really like the French Roast when I first tasted it either, so you might want to take this with a grain of salt until I've had a few more opportunities to sample the product and compare it to other varieties.  I'll update if my opinion changes with time, but on first try, I doubt I'd buy this again.  It's better than the Rainforest Blend, but I'd be more likely to buy the French Roast than this.<br /><br />Like other One Cup varieties, these leave a bit more sediment in the bottom of the cup and produce more \"crema\" - the brownish foam floating on top of a good cup of coffee - than most traditional K-Cups.  The Fog Chaser seems to produce less than either the French Roast or the Rainforest Blend, for what it's worth. I found the flavor just a little on the thin and bitter side."}
