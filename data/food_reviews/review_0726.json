High in calories, low in quality, you get what you pay for.  I had to take and mix one of these with a cup of regular coffee to make it drinkable.  Granted, I've only had 2 cups of it but I'm going to give the rest of the box away.  Save yourself the disappointment and the money and avoid this garbage."}
