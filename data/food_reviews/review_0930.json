WOW!","text":"OK when Amazon sent notice about a new K-cup variety availiable for Pre-order I did not hesitate. The price was right and the choices aplenty. I ordered a box each of the Columbian and the Breakfast Blend. The day they arrived I immediately had to try a cup. So I picked the Columbian , popped it into the Keurig ( as I have done a 1000 times!) and coffee grounds and water started splurting out of the sides like a fountain!! Ok so I thought it was it was just a fluke, so after cleaning up the mess , I decide to try another K-cup and the same thing happens again! This happened with both varieties consistently. This has rarely happened with any other K-cup variety I have tried since owning my Kuerig machine for 3 years now.I plan to contact Amazon about this even though they have a no refund policy on grocery items. But one thing is for sure I wont be purchasing anymore of this brand until they address this problem. I cant even comment on the taste of the cofffe.<br /><br />UPDATE!!! This company has outstanding customer service! After leaving this less than glowing  review , they contacted me! thats right! Emailed on a tuesday and had 2 new boxes on thurday! I have only tried the the Columbian(Love it!) and the Breakfast blend.Both were a very tasty medium roast that stood up well to creamer.Now that they have addresed the problem with a small batch from the preorders I will definately be ordering more. Every one of these k-cups worked perfect and the coffee is fresh and delicious."}
