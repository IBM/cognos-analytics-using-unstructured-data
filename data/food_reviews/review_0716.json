Grove square also has \"coffee\" which you wouldn't serve to your worst enemy. The taste is worse than Pakastani gas station brew, it's more like Nescafe that's been left to burn in a pot for hours. If you think this review is an exaggeration and you have money to waste, try it out, and then proceed to throw $10 in the trash can. Keurig should seriously consider removing all of Grove square's products."}
