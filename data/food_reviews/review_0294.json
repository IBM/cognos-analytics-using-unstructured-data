I was a little worried when I saw that instead of all plastic, this actually is made out of very little plastic and the coffee is actually held in material just like regular coffee filters.  I love that they are not as destructive to the environment as the others.  The company really believes in freshness since they put these little pod/pouches in a sealed pouch and then stick them in the cardboard.<br /><br />Now mind you I am truly wedded to my Green Mountain Dark Magic, but I decided to try this because of the price.  And I'm not one bit sorry I did, I feel a tad guilty for semi-abandoning my Green Mountain! This Fogchaser blend  makes a good strong  cup of coffee without giving me the  feeling that the lining of my stomach is going to burn out.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to see that I now have an alternative to Green Mountain and I can even save money since it is at least 3 dollars cheaper (at least in my grocery store) a package."}
