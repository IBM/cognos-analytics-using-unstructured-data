I put it into a larger cup and diluted it a bit more which brought out the mango and pineapple flavors more. It still has a \"diet\" aftertaste which I'm not thrilled about, but I do appreciate that it doesn't have aspartame in it. These handy packets would be good to travel with, especially when traveling abroad where you shouldn't drink anything other than bottled water. I also thought that the nutritional information is a little misleading. The front of the package boasts that it's only five calories per 8 oz serving, but these are made to be poured directly into a 16 oz bottle of water so in reality there are two servings per packet, making it ten calories. Not a lot of a difference, but for a calorie counting person it is a difference."}
