Great Price!","text":"I buy this for my husband & also as an occasional treat for my older kids. Since we are a family of 6, the Keurig is not exactly economical. However, since I found these cappuccino k-cups, it makes it much easier to fit in our budget. And they love the flavor! The French Vanilla ones are great too!"}
