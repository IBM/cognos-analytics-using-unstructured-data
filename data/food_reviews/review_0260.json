I had been paying nearly $40 for Starbucks at a wholesale club and only for 40 cups. I had cut myself to one cup per day! Then my friend shared this link and I thought \"Why not!\" It arrived quickly, and smelled heavenly. I like dark, strong coffee, and I could tell by the smell it would fit the bill. The real test is in making it. I brewed it this morning--no grounds in my coffee, and no residue left in my cup. Wondered if the soft filter cup at the bottom would work, and it does. How great is that???? It doesn't taste like instant coffee either, which some imitations do. 80 cups for $33 is an awesome deal...that is around $0.42 a cup. If you buy the little boxes at WalMart you only get 18 for $10..which is around $0.61 per cup...you save $0.19 per cup, which doesn't sound like a lot, but you would spend $50 buying as much at WalMart to get 80 K cups. So you are saving $17. I love it!!! Order yours today, you won't be disappointed."}
