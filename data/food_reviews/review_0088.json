Initially in cold water, the mixture clumps up if not shaken well, but it eventually disolves completely.  The flavors complement each other well, the sweetness of blackberry tempered by the tartness of pomegranate.  Lipton's product is much more flavorful than some of the Crystal Light varieties I have tried.  I would definitely buy this product and try some of the other flavors."}
