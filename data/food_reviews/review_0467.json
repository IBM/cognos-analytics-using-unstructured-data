First, I'd like to mention that this product is intentionally labeled to have a really short shelf-life, and not to ensure freshness.<br /><br />The funny thing about expiration dates is that for something like this, it honestly doesn't matter. I've gotten batches that are expired (for cheaper) and the taste is the same great amazing taste as it was when it was well within the \"Best Until\" range. Yes, I have taken two packs, one expired and one not expired, and they both are the same delicious taste.<br /><br />The reality is that expiration dates are a wonderful tool that make people throw perfectly fine food and go out and buy more. Especially with dairy products: If it's a few days over, most people will toss out cartons of perfectly good milk or eggs that could keep for another five weeks, which keeps people buying it more frequently. The fact is, if you would drink it without knowing the expiration date is past (it doesn't smell or look bad) then it's not only safe to eat, but a waste to toss.<br /><br />This isn't true for drugs, however. If your medicine says it's expired, it's expired. Also, condoms. Those do lose integrity over time.<br /><br />So, this is a product that intentionally has a very short shelf-life because it makes ridiculous people go, \"Oh, no, instead of getting it cheaper online and in bulk, I'll just buy a lot of more expensive smaller packs for more money.\" Starbucks enjoys charging their consumers for their instant coffee like it's magical pixie dust, and the only way they can stop people from buying it from other cheaper sources is to give it a tiny shelf-life. Look at some of the other reviews, here. It's working!"}
