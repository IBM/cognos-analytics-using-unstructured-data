We're not quite coffee snobs, but we're WELL past Starbucks & corporate coffee. I'm always hesitant to try something other than our favorites from our local roaster here in Kansas City, but this dark blend is just excellent. It's smooth, not bitter, and doesn't require me to add a ton of half & half to get it to my liking. I'm really excited to have found another coffee to indulge in - and while it's not local to ME, per se, it's a small local business and I am ALWAYS happy to support small, family run companies. I'm really anxious to try to the Corner Donut Shop blend next. Yay for java!"}
