I was a little concerned that it might be too sweet with the honey and strawberry, but it's really just delightful. At my office we keep To Go Stix in the break room for whoever to use and we have a new regular box on the shelf. Everyone loved the way this tasted. You should give it a shot, you'll be happy you did."}
