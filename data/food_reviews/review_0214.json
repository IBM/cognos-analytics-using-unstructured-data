The pod packaging is minimal.  I agree there is very little waste.  The top looks like a typical k-cup and the bottom looks like a filter.  You will want some sort of tupperware or jar to store the onecups once you open the pouch they come in since they will be exposed somewhat to air and lose freshness otherwise.  I just use a spare ice cream tub and dump the open bag in there.  Perfect!<br /><br />Today I made myself a larger cup than usual by accident and it was still rich and delicious.<br /><br />I usually drink the Newman's own coffee that I buy at Costco to give you an idea of my tastes.  I think this is better."}
