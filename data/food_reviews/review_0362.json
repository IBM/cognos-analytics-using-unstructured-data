Instead of being in a fully plastic container, only the top is plastic. The bottom part is enclosed in a coffee filter type holding. While this means that when I opened the sealed wrapper I was hit with the delicious aroma of coffee, something I miss when I open a regular pack of k-cups, it also means I have to store the remaining cups in a tupperware or storage ziploc type bag to keep the remaining cups from going stale. This isn't a big deal, just something to mention. These also wouldn't fit in the normal k-cup carousel.<br /><br />I have a b60 and the cup fit perfectly, brewed up great, disposal was easy and the filter didn't tear or leak as I was throwing it way.<br /><br />Fog chaser is a bold deep brew (I brew on the middle button of my keurig) The coffee is very smooth and mellow with a terrific aroma. There is no bitter or burned taste. This is quickly becoming my favorite keurig coffee and I can't wait to try the other offerings from this company."}
