It is so quick and easy to whip up a cup and it tastes great.  I use it at work, home, camping, road trips, etc.  Pick up a small electric kettle and you can have it just about anywhere on trips as long as you have access to water and electricity.  I have used it on cruise ships when the coffee is terrible or at conferences for the same reason.  They usually have hot water for tea, so I just use one of these.<br /><br />One note of caution though, it is smooth but don't drink it too fast or else you will be seeing through walls.  Then again, sometimes seeing through walls could be kind of fun.  What I mean is that to me, it has more of a kick to it than regular coffee."}
