Heat your water, tap the powder out of the tube into a cup, pour and stir.  No grinding, no filters, no mudding the beans; it's just as fast, and just as easy, and spooning crystals out of a jar.  But Starbucks VIA is far, far superior to any other kind of instant, and gives a lot of second rate brews a run for their money.  Is it as good as my best beans, freshly ground and brewed?  No.  But it's better than the coffee that comes out of Keurig packs, and better than the coffee from fast-food restaurants.  And it's instant.  Sometimes you'll want to take the time and trouble for the best possible cup of coffee; and sometimes you'll just want a dang cup of something hot, strong and black.  For those times VIA is a great choice."}
