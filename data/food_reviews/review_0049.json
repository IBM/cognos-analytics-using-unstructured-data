Then, the mix came out in a cloud or lumps. I admit that I tried this after having a packet in my car for while but then it is made to travel, right?<br /><br />The taste is OK but nothing exciting. If I thought about it, I could taste the tea and honey but mostly I tasted the sweet Kool-Aid type taste.<br /><br />I was excited to find this as I cannot tolerate artificial sweetner. The sweetner (besides honey) is made from sugar but is low cal. I'm not sure how that is going to work for me.<br /><br />Overall, not bad but not exciting."}
