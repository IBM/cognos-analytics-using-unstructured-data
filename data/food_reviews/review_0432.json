I am the only one in my household who drinks coffee, so brewing a pot was a waste.  I have tried the Keurig coffee makers, but they don't seem to make a better cup of coffee than the instant VIA.  This was a much cheaper solution and gives me the same quality of coffee.  I will continue to buy VIA for my coffee fix in the morning."}
