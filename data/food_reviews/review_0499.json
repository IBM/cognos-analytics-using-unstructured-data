I am not a soda drinker, but when I travel I prefer a Coca Cola or Pepsi to this foul \"coffee\". It reminds me of the old Sanka instant coffee, but is much stronger and much more bitter. Totally disgusting! The only people who could drink this crap are those who use flavored creamers and/or loads of sugar so they don't taste any of this foul coffee."}
