If you enjoy a full flavored medium roast you'll enjoy this one. It has complex flavors and a smooth finish.<br />That said, it's definitely not full bodied or bold in flavor. My favorite k-cups are Coffee People Organic, Newman's Special Blend Organic, Emril's Big Easy Bold and Timothy's Rainforest Espresso. If you like deep bold coffee flavor this one comes up short."}
