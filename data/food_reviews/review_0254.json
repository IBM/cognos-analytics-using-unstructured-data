The folks who like a bold strong coffee love this one.  I like it as well, but I use the 10-oz setting when I make it instead of my typical 8-oz.<br />\"Fogchaser\" sums it up pretty well.  This will clear your head and get you ready to roll.<br />I also love that there is less packaging.  I must admit to a bit of guilt over the whole K-Cup disposal situation.  (I make people use china coffee cups and am happy to wash them!)  These do not have the plastic outer cup.  I keep them in a plastic container with a sealed lid instead of in the K-Cup carousel to keep them fresher.  But I gotta tell you--opening that lid yields the most wonderful coffee aroma."}
