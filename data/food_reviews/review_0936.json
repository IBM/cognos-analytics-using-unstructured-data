Upon opening lid the coffee was oozing out of top of K Cups and made a real mess. cleaned machine and tried it again and same thing happened.  Then tried other brand k cups and they worked perfectly as usuall!!!  Dont know if I just got a \"bad batch\" but all other brands work fine. I will try a couple more times and then will probably dump them...gave a couple to my friends to see what happens in their machine....still luv my CUISINART KERUIG though!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE:  The company sent me a replacement box for the above mentioned ones.....Decaf...The first one worked ok and the coffee was OK...but THEN THE SAME THINGS HAPPENED AS IN PREVIOUS POST. Have tried 5 of them they all were defective...and other brands worked just fine...So wont be wanting anymore of them. customer service was very nice but they just need to fix the cups."}
