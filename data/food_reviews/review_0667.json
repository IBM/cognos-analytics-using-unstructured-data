She told me that she thought I would like them, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />She was right! I absolutely loved the,, and after running out of the samples decided to order some from Amazon. After ordering those, I saw these Caramel flavored ones and knew I had to try them!<br /><br />I was so excited when they arrived that I didn't waste any time and instantly brewed one up and tried it. I liked it even better than the French Vanilla ones!<br /><br />For me, they were the perfect ammount of sweetness, and I didn't find there to be any weird artificial sweetner taste as some other reviwers have mentioned.<br /><br />Now I drink one of these every day. There is nothing I prefer more in the morning than one of these.<br /><br />Maybe these aren't for the hardcore coffee connoisseur, but for someone like me, they are awesome!<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to everyone. Especially people who normally don't like coffee. A+ and 5 stars in my book."}
