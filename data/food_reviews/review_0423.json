A great price on decent instant coffee. Does it taste like freshed brewed? No, nothing other than freshed brewed coffee tastes that good. Does it taste better than other name brand instant coffee?

A hot water dispenser, a travel cup and off to work I go.<br />Expiration date was March 2012.<br /><br />My second order arrived today. Expiration April 2012."}
