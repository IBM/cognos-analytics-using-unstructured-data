How they managed to replicate the original Starbuck's flavor--dark, over-the-top rich roast, I don't know. But I swear it's the same as buying a fresh cup during your morning commute. Most of the oils are dissipated, so you won't have the same strong aroma as freshly brewed, but the flavor is fantastic."}
