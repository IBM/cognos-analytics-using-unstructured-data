It was too sweet and in fact it didn't taste much like tea to me. I feel bad about saying this, because I'm a Lipton Tea lover. I make iced tea by putting three tea bags in a two quart bottle and setting it in the sun for a day and that kind of iced tea is so very much better than this. Sorry, Lipton, I wanted to like this, but I didn't, not a bit."}
