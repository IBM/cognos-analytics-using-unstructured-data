Needless to say, I serve a LOT of coffee!  Unique in appearance, the San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser K-Cups deliver a great cup of coffee!  As other reviews state, you'll notice a heavenly, strong coffee aroma when opening the air-tight plastic packaging.  Once opened, I store my Fog Chaser K-Cups in an empty, (clean) large metal coffee can.  It not only keeps the aroma intact, it keeps the K-Cups nice and fresh for brewing.<br /><br />If you haven't already tried these K-Cups, do!  I think you'll be impressed - and pleased that you don't have to pay top-dollar for a quality product!"}
