For the most part making a cup of coffee without a coffee maker couldn't be more easy or delicious, though I find that these Via Ready Brews (all flavors I've tried so far) have often a hint of a bitter after taste. Its not so bad that its undesirable, however, I'm sure that goes with having the ground micro-ground to produce your coffee as opposed to filtering through larger grounds to make coffee. I will say as for 'instant' coffee - this is one of the best I've had. Each flavor has a distinct aroma and taste. Doesn't quite replace a freshly brewed cup of coffee though."}
