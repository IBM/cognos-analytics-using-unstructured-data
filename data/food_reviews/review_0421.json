I've only tried the Italian and Columbia varieties.  The convenience is a major factor, and it beats the pants off anything \"instant\" I've ever had before.  Great for backpacking.  The ability to do a 50-count bulk purchase is the way to go, though, as buying 3-packs locally is steep--but perhaps not so much when one considers the price of a cup of the real thing.  My only beef is that my most recent purchase had a \"best by\" date just 2.5 months away (a complaint I've seen others make).  I spoke with a Starbucks rep who claimed it was still going to be fine for some unspecified time beyond that date, that they'd take my return if desired, but that they couldn't promise that the date on whatever replacement shipped from the warehouse would be any further distant.  Kind of lame...but I'm going through it quickly enough that the question is probably moot."}
