I used the first one and the Keurig seemed to drip out instead of flow. I tried to use a regular K-Cup that I had and it worked fine. I tried this with over 10 of The Brooklyn K-Cups, I am completely dissatisified, and wish I could rate this lower than a 1. I would never buy another one of their products!!"}
