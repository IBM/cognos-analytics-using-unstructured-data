It dissolves as the hot water runs through the K-Cup.  But it is so refreshing and fast when you need a pick-me-up cup of coffee.  The flavor is wonderful.  My husband and I also like the hazelnut and caramel flavors.  You can't beat this price, especially with \"Subscribe and Save\".  I have found Grove Square at HEB in Texas, but it is more expensive than the price here.  I'm not very picky about it being a perfectly brewed coffee with deep, rich taste.  I just want something that is hot and tasty.  Try it out and if you don't like it, share it with a friend or family member who will be glad to have some free, good coffee.  A box of 18 K-Cups makes a great hostess gift.  By the way, the order is for 3 boxes of 18, a total of 54 cups of coffee.  I wasn't too clear on that when I ordered the first time.  Why pay $3 for a cup at Starbucks when this is just as good, convenient at home, and tastes great?"}
