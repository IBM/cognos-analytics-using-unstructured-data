BUT... I can't drink VIA made according to it's instructions. It's just way, WAY, too strong. (I'm talking seriously stronger than what you get at a local Starbucks.) Let me explain. When I make brewed coffee, I freshly grind beans to a very fine texture, using two or three tablespoons of grounds per 6 ounces of water. So I'm used to a strong cup of coffee. Since one packet of VIA makes even a large mug of water into an un-drinkablly strong brew, I use only half a packet. The problem is, a couple hours later, the left-over half becomes an unusable blob that won't come out of the packet. No great loss... I've had a GREAT cup of coffee, and I can just toss the other half packet, right? Well, acutally, that's a problem for me. I'm of the 'clean your plate / starving kids in Biafra' generation. I would prefer a smaller packet at a smaller price. So one star off from someone who was taught 'waste not, want not' and is too old to change ;-)"}
