I love a strong coffee taste and this is almost at my limit for too strong, but not quite.  It's wonderful as iced coffee.  I didn't have a problem with the expiration date.  First order was in March and expired in December; second order in May, expired end of November and anyway, how bad can coffee get in individual packets even 5 years after the expiration date really?<br /><br />My problem is that the description says 1. POUR IN PACKET 2. ADD HOT WATER 3. STIR AND ENJOY - which is fine if you use a tea kettle.  If you microwave water in the mug first and try to use the pencil-sized opening at the top of the packet as indicated (which isn't super easy to use anyway), it steams up the opening and the coffee gets stuck.  It's messy to work around it by prying open the rest of the packet so the opening is larger, or cutting diagonally with scissors.  Even heating the water in a separate container the packet gets five out of ten for ease of use as the video demonstrates.<br /><br />Starbucks - this could easily be resolved by adding another quarter inch at the top and engineering a wider opening at the top."}
