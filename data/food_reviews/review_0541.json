We have bought and brewed just about all of the best coffees out there, including Starbucks whole beans.  We tried instant coffee, the usual brands to see if we could tolerate it, instead of waiting and watching the percolator, so it would'nt boil over on the stove.  The usual brands were tolerable.  That was until we tried the real deal...Starbucks Via Ready Brew Coffee.  I'd say that it is just about the best cup of coffee from Starbucks ever!"}
