We were excited to try this as they all love ice tea, but surprisingly it was not the biggest hit in my house. My husband, who loves honey and has been on a honey kick lately, said that it \"tastes like Kool-Aid\". He did drink it but said that he wouldn't be likely to purchase it. My children liked it a bit better than my husband did but they prefer products more like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4ADKU\">MIO Fruit Punch, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. The bottom line? We likely won't be purchasing this again."}
