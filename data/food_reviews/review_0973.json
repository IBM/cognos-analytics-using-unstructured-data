THE BEANS!<br />We received a sampler pack from this Brooklyn Bean, and were amazed with the quality, taste and overall service from this company!<br />Our first sample pack never made it to us.. But they were awesome enough to SPEEDILY send us another one within a few DAYS!<br />My husband is a \"STRONG\" guy- who likes his coffee straight up.. Dark, rich and all alone (no creamer or sugars.. just black!). He enjoyed the darker blends.<br />While myself, Am a light & sweet kind of gal, and the milder blends provided a great flavor that complimented my french vanilla creamer perfectly!<br />Overall, we LOVED our box, and are quickly running low! Thank goodness we have Amazon Prime, and can order this in a jiff when we order again!<br />This is certainly going to overtake our kcup storage rack now!<br />STRONGLY RECOMMEND!! :)"}
