No ... Instant Starbucks!!!","text":"I admit, I am a coffee snob. I buy good whole bean coffee and make it fresh ground at home. And I make it very strong.<br /><br />I love Starbucks coffee. But I was skeptical about this instant version. However, I have to say it is very close the real thing! I am quite happy to make a cup of VIA when I don't feel like making a whole pot! It's SO easy and delicious!"}
