I'm always looking to mix up my selection because that is one of the true benefits of the Keurig machines. I read the reviews trying to determine how dark/strong Fog Chaser was and could not quite nail down the strength. I relied on the name and thankfully knew about the packaging. I keep mine in a canister after realizing I had an extra one to spare, which will keep the air out. I quite liked the k-cup design, it looks like it creates less waste.<br /><br />Fog Chaser clearly says on the side that it is a darker brown but does not show that it is the strongest. I will have to investigate which is stronger. This k-cup did give me a nice smooth strong 12 oz cup of coffee. It had no weird after taste and it wasn't bitter. I forgive bitter strong coffees because that is a product, often enough, of stronger coffees that could be manufactured better. I'm no snob but I also don't drink watered down coffee (i.e. Starbuck's new Blonde coffee).<br /><br />I will definitely order this again. I've never had coffee from this company before but I think I'm quite the fan. I also ordered the 3 12 packs because they shipped sooner and the idea that they would stay fresher longer was appealing. The price was slightly higher though, of course. Now that I have a canister that fits 36, I will go ahead and buy the other packaging and likely subscribe."}
