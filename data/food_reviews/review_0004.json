The addition of the mango and pineapple flavors adds to the terrific taste.  And just 5 calories...WOW! Iced is refreshing, and my husband likes to drink it hot.  I have shared this with friends, and recently we had some workmen at the house. It was a hot day and I gave them tall glasses of this tea with ice.  It was enjoyed by all!  Would recommend this product to everyone who likes iced tea."}
