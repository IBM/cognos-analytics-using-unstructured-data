I had seen it on Amazon but when I saw it local I gave it a try and I am glad I did.  This is a rich and robust flavor, with a note of nuts, one that wipes the cobwebs away in the morning.  Yes it is nice that the product uses less plastic but that is only a side note the quality of the coffee is top notch.  The only negative side comment I can make is that sometimes the top gets stuck on the upper needle of the Keurig but no problem just pull it off from the top rather than picking it up out of the brewing basket, and if you close the machine and open again it is always off the needle anyway."}
