I guessed wrong.  Which shocked me and converted me.<br />I know that it is not freeze dried coffee.  It is (in part) ground particles of the coffee bean.  It makes it taste absolutely fresh brewed.  I love the convenient little packages.  They make coffee on the run easier than you'd believe.<br />I order every month for my husband and me and have not bought whole coffee beans in over a year."}
