I thought that it was really sweet, luckily I had a bigger water bottle than the directions said because I don't think I would have been able to drink it based on the directions. I could definitly taste and smell the fake sugar that is in it (Sucralose) so I was a little confused when it said that it was sweetend with honey. I would not buy this product again."}
