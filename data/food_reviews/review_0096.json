I would think this is false advertising if you claim a product is all natural and has ingredients that are not natural??? It is overly sweet and really doesn't taste natural to me.<br />so this is a Warning that this product contains sucralose (splenda)<br />I had thought it would only be sweetened with honey because that is the only sweetener mentioned in the description."}
