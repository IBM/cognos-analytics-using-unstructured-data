I purchased a personalized variety pack of K-cups on amazon and this cup was included.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to the artificial flavoring of many K-cups.  This tastes smooth, creamy, and sweet (bc of the caramel).  It tastes like it could have come straight from the coffee shop, really!<br /><br />You don't have to add any cream or anything because it is already included in the cup.  The only complaint that I can imagine others might have is its level of sweetness, if they don't like sweet cappuccinos, but then don't purchase one that is caramel flavored right?"}
