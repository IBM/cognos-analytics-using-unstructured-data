Top seal opens up and sometimes the filter inside shifts and grinds jam up the coffeemaker.  Many of the cups are stale as a result of the poor seal.  I purchased 4 different Brooklyn Bean Roastery flavors and they all had the same issue.<br />Company was contacted and quick to send replacement, unfortunately these also failed and many were stale. Hope they correct their product."}
