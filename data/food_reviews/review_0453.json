I was pretty skeptical of an instant coffee but found it at the grocery market for $1 for the package of 3. At first, I thought it was going to be way too strong and bitter but I was pleasantly surprised. It was smooth and full of flavor as if I just bought it fresh at the cafe. I added Truvia to it also and couldn't have had a better cup 'o joe. I am hooked!"}
