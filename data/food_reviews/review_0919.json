(Confession: I am partial to the Brooklyn Bridge and have lived in Brooklyn.)<br /><br />Revision:  This batch was packed loose in a box without apparent damage.  I wrapped my entire machine in a white plastic bag. The cup when punctured released a pleasant coffee smell.  It brewed without incident -- afterwards the top hole was a little larger than with Green Mountain, but without noticeable side effects.<br /><br />The coffee tasted thin, weak, and burnt -- like it had been left heating on a stove stop -- worst yet. Maybe I can use them to add acid to the soil.  But -- my wife loves it -- so I am compromising and giving it a four.<br /><br />Curious, I tore it open and compared with a Green Mountain.  The foil of the BB seemed slightly less substantial, the coffee a lighter brown, and more coarsely ground.<br /><br />The filter of the BB seemed thinner, but more voluminous. It was torn, but almost certainly I did that getting it out -- there were no grounds in my cup.  The two K-cups looked similar, but BB cup picked up indentations from the fins on the bottom of the receptacle -- the GM cup did not."}
