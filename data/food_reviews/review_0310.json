(this is the smallest Mr Coffee made by Keurig and is brand new), but it would only brew half a cup and sometimes the pressure would rupture the seal on the k cup and grounds would overflow...I bought the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser and not only is the taste awesome...but my keurig loves them...I think the filter bottom vs, the plastic cup allows the water to flow thru better and I get a full cup every time and no more mess!  I was going to return the Keurig and try something different...Not now!  Mr. Coffee Single Serve Powered by Keurig Brewing Technology"}
