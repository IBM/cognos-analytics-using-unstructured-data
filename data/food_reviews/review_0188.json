I like a bold blend and this one is great.  I really liked the new packaging, which works great in my Cuisinart Keurig machine.  It came in a box of 36, 3 sealed plastic bags of 12 each.  Stays very fresh in the sealed bags.  I put the open bag in the fridge to keep the coffee fresh (not sure I really have to bother doing that, but I do).  I'll try the French blend next, but Fog Chaser is definately my new love."}
