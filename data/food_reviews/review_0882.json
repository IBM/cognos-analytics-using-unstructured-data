The brooklyn bridge blend was the better of the two but it is just ok. The packaging is just poor. I have brewed about a dozen cups between the two blends and nearly every one has been full of grounds or worse.I have had to clean out the k-cup holder in the machine twice because it was jammed full of coffee grounds. Some of the cups when taken out show the foil separated from the plastic. I ended up with a mouth full of coffee grounds in my last cup and decided to throw the rest away."}
