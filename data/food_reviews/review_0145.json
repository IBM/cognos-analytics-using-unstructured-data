Even just using half the package, there is still a real lot of flavor and it is hard to believe there isn't a lot of sugar in it, as it tastes so sweet.  You don't have to worry about mixing it, as the package states, as it dissolves well and whatever is left over will dissolve in the next serving anyway.  I found myself going to the water cooler about two to three times more often than normal because it tastes so good.  Both the flavors I had were good so you will probably be pleased with any of the flavors you try."}
