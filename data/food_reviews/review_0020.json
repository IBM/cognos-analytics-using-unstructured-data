While I was a bit skeptical of the five calories proposed for each 8-ounce serving, seeing as how honey is a fairly high caloric sweetener, I figured I'd give it a go anyway. So after receiving the tea, I mixed it up per the instructions and took a sip. Yowzas! The tea was super sweet with a bit of strawberry flavor and no tea that I could taste. I ended up watering the tea down enough that one packet, which is usually two servings, ends up as four or five 8-oz. servings. The berry flavor became very diluted while there was still that taste of icky sweetness. Overall the berry flavors and tea are weak, even undiluted, and I noticed no honey flavor what-so-ever, so took a look-see at the ingredients where I spotted sucralose (an artificial sweetener) thrown right in the middle of things. Now that is where the sweetness is and don't take kindly to that addition, as I avoid artificial sweeteners whenever possible. Seeing as how Lipton is sneakily claiming this is sweetened with honey (And look! NO aspartame!), with no mention that in actuality the sweeteners are honey granules, which are made from both honey and sugar, and sucralose except by viewing the ingredients list, makes me angry because I've been swindled. Yeah, this is natural all right. I'm definitely not going to trust Lipton's marketing from now on and urge them to think about switching to a natural sweetener such as stevia. So if you like your food natural, best to skip this, but if you're not so picky and don't mind artificial sweeteners in your food, then give it a go if you're interested. I'll not be trying any other flavors of this product."}
