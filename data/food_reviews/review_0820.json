I am not an expert but like everyone else some coffees definitely taste better then others and you can have starbucks and probably dunkin donut as I truly enjoy this one and drink it other times during the day when I feel like a cup.<br />It is a nice blend and tastes delicious no bitter or after taste and I have tried your other blends but also enjoy the decaf when it is later at night.  Served it to friends who live and even used to live in Brooklyn and they agree it is a winner.<br />Keep making this delicious product at an affordable price and you will have a customer for life."}
