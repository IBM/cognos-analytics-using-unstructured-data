The rim sits perfectly in my Keurig machine. When you close the lid of your machine, the product is punctured from the top only. The filter is sort of bowl-shaped and doesn't make contact with the lower puncture needle, but you really wouldn't want it to puncture a filter anyway - you'd have grounds in your coffee. It's a clever idea, actually.<br /><br />I was skeptical about this product because the box doesn't have the \"Keurig\" co-branding that all the others do, but given the variation to the cup design, I can now understand why. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The taste was quite good and strong, and is the closest thing to real coffee-pot coffee that I've had in 3+ years of Keurig machine cup samplings. I had no coffee grounds in the cup, and it was quite satisfying.<br /><br />By way of background, my all-time favorite variety is Tullys French Roast, and I prefer dark roasts. The box for San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser says its a combination of their regular roast and their french. Its not as strong as Tullys French but it's definitely not weak. My machine is the B77 model which has 4 size settings. Going from small to large, I used the third size which is 7.25 ounces and I was very satisfied with the taste and strength.<br /><br />I wanted to start with the small 12 count box at the market to try them out. Really, who wants 80 cups of something you might not like? But now I know it's a winner, I'll be getting them here regularly where they are even more affordable."}
