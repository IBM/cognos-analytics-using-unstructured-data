Yes, it has honey as a sweetener but it's \"honey granules (sugar, honey.)\" As well, other sweeteners are sucralose, maltodextrin, and isomalt.  These ingredients are not disclosed in the description but they are on the package.  I have no idea how it tastes because I didn't taste it; my preference is not to ingest chemical sweeteners or sugar.  In addition, one 8-ounce serving has 10 mg caffeine; one packet is two servings.<br /><br />I'm only giving this product 1-star because of  lack of disclosure.  When I read the description in the Vine Newsletter I was under the impression this product was sweetened with honey only. This is not the case.  If you don't mind sugar or chemical sweeteners then I suggest you read other reviews about flavor."}
