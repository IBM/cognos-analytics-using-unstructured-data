Very robust but super smooth flavor, almost sweet.  The only downside to these is having to keep them in a sealed bag, which isn't much of a negative...  Can't stop raving about how good this coffee tastes.  My husband loves strong coffee and I usually don't like most of them because they can be bitter.  This is the smoothest strong coffee I have ever had!"}
