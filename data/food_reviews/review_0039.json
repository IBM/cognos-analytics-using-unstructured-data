I drink the Ocean Spray and Crystal Light ones all the time. I like iced tea so I figured that I might like this too. That wasn't the case. I found this didn't mix in as well and while it smelled awesome, the favor just wasn't there for me. It smelled like strawberries but didn't really taste like them. There was maybe a hint of strawberries when you first take a drink but the after taste from the green tea didn't really work for me. I think I'd skip these next time."}
