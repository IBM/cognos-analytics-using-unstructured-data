I have been puncturing the top of the kcup with a thumbtack before brewing as not to have an issue with the packaging. A couple of the kcups seem to get somewhat smashed in the brewer and I have never had that problem with other kcups before.  Don't think I would order these again.<br />They seem to have too many issues with the packaging and I should have waited until this was resolved. I'm going back to using my kcup."}
