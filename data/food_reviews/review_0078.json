It is  that deep red color and pretty sweet tasting. I was pretty impressed since I am not a huge powdered drink fan. And, I normally am all about plain water. But we had a week or so without juice in the house and this gave me a sort of juice-fix. I mostly drank it in a glass, so not all the little powder bits mixed in as well as they would have in a bottle of water.<br /><br />The way the little packets rip open is really nice, they are already sort of halfway torn for you, and at an angle, so the powder falls pretty neatly into the drink.<br /><br />I'd recommend these to someone who enjoyed falvoring their water."}
