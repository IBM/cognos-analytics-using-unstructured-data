Then, after checking out the stats, I was even more hooked and ordered the Caramel right away.  I do a low sugar or sugar free diet and this fits perfectly into my diet as a treat.  With only 80 calories, 4.5 grams of fat and 5 sugars, it's a win/win situation for me.  I do brew it with 10 oz of water instead of 8, otherwise it's just a little too sweet for me.  All in all, I'm very happy with this product and will order more when I run out."}
