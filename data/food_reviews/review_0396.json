I was not disappointed as this is a strong, but not too strong, good-tasting coffee that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds.  This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee.  You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a \"clean\" look from a normal K-cup pod.  This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.  I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  Who knows, I may have found a new favorite coffee!"}
