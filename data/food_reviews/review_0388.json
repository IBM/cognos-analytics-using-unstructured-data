It's pretty awesome.","text":"I don't usually write a review unless I think a item deserves it but this coffee deserves it. It came in 3 separate vacuum sealed bags. Make sure you store them in a proper container after you open them or they will go bad. When I opened one, the smell was super strong. I thought the coffee was going to be bitter but after brewing it in my Keurig B130 a few times I was hooked. Not bitter at all but the smell is a little strong. But it grew on me. I brew it with 8oz. of water and the strength is good enough for me. Just a bit of creamer or milk and no sugar. I drink only a cup a day. Also, its cheaper than normal K cups and less waste. I'm not going to say that this will be my favorite forever, but it is good and if you are looking at trying something new with your K cup maker then these are worth a shot. I will keep these stocked along with other the flavors of K cups I have enjoyed."}
