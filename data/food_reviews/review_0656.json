Before my favorite coffee was from Starbucks, the Caramel Machiato.  But I absolutely LOVE this coffee.  I don't really care that it is instant, because I think it tastes really good.  My favorite thing is that on the medium Keurig setting I do not have to do a thing to it to enjoy it.  No sugar, no cream, no nothing.  Just pop the K-cup in, hit the button and enjoy.  If you are not a really big coffee snob and like sweet flavored coffees you might love this one, I do."}
