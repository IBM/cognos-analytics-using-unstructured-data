I've tried the Backberry/Pomegranite, Mango/Pineapple, and the Strawberry /Acai.  My favorite is the Mango but the strawberry is a close second.  They are convenient, just put one packet into a bottle of water, shake and go.  They completely dissolve and are only 5 calories.  Especialy with the weather getting hotter, I will be drinking a lot more of these."}
