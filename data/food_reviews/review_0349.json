I couldn't even finish the cup I brewed.<br /><br />I don't really mind that they're not actually K-Cups. Who cares if they get stale? You're not going to want to drink the coffee even if it's fresh.<br /><br />I just wanted to edit to describe the flavor better. It tastes burnt. It tastes like someone put their cigarette out in my coffee. I'm out of my good Timothy's K-Cups so I had to use these again tonight, and once again, I'm bot going to be able to finish it."}
