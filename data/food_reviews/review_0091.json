Super refreshing to drink on a nice hot or warm day and I especially enjoyed it after a walk around the park. Quenched my thirst and didn't leave any disgusting after taste in my mouth that some other mix ins can leave. Super easy to mix into my drink: I just opened the packet, poured it into my cup, added cold water, and stirred. I had to stir for awhile to break everything up all the way otherwise I can see myself drinking little undissolved particles.<br /><br />What was so interesting about the flavor for me was how refreshing it was to drink and so flavorful. Right away you can taste the mango and pineapple, which are a perfect combination together, but there is also a hint of green tea behind those flavors. Thrown throughout the whole blend is a slight taste of honey that just compliments everything together. If your a fan of these flavors and are looking for a really refreshing drink, I have to say give Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea & Honey, Mango Pineapple a try for I am sure you will find it just as delightful and refreshing as I did.<br /><br />Please note that this is 5 calories per a serving, but keep in mind that 1 packet contains 2 servings so in fact it is 10 calories per a serving that I have been using. But I have also been using it in a really tall glass that holds more then 8oz of water (More like 13ishoz) hence both servings work just perfect for my taste level. Enjoy!"}
