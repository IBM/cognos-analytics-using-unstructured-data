When I purchased the 12-pack decaf VIA packets in the Starbucks store, the best before date was at least a few months away. The 6-pack of 3-count packets which I received from Amazon has a best before date which is about 5 weeks away. I doubt I can use 18 packets in 5 weeks, but I also saved a good amount versus what I would have paid in the store. It's really a matter of individual usage. Perhaps many people use one packet every couple of days, but I usually don't need it that frequently."}
