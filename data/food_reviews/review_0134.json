A quick and easy way to give water a kick.  I have used plenty of drink sticks and discovered some are better than others.  This blend is by Lipton and the flavor is a decaf green tea with honey and strawberry acai.  The name of this flavor seems like a pretty robust title to live up to.<br /><br />I must say that the flavor is really good, not too sweet but sweet enough.  None of the flavors are overpowering yet all of them are present.  The beverage is only 5 calories a serving and has no caffeine, which is alright in my book.  My only complaint is that it took me quite a while to mix this powder into the water.  I am not sure why that was the case, but in the large scheme of things this is a minor issue.  For someone who is looking for a good way to spice up their water without too many calories, this drink by Lipton might be a good solution."}
