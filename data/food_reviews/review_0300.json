I have tried each of the Rogers family flavors and find them all aromatic and good tasting.  Only one downfall, as they cannot be stored in my countertop carousel.  This flavorful coffee is well worth the inconvenience of having to store the unused cups in an air tight container.  Who would think that such an economical coffee could taste so good."}
