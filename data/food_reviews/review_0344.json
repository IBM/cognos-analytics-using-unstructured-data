I was a little concerned with the packaging in that the bottom of the K-cup is a filter and not solid plastic like a standard one.  However, aside from a very fine trace at the bottom of my coffee mug, there is no mess and no fuss.  The coffee is very smooth, too.  I will be making this one of my regular choices for K-cups from now on."}
