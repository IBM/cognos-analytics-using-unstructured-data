Buying a pack of 50 was too much since I have no idea how it tastes like so I bought a 3 pack sample from my local Starbucks. I've got to say this is definitely one the better tasting instant coffee's I have tried. I haven't tried that many to be sure but with many of the other brands, you can definitely tell that you were drinking cheap instant coffee. Those definitely got the job done but it just wasn't very fun drinking them. With the VIA, the coffee actually tastes fresh and lively. I'm not really a coffee snob and so there's not much bad to say in the taste department.<br /><br />Because I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, it can be a hassle sometimes to grind the beans and use my french press. For those times when I'm feeling especially lazy, I can now count on brewing a cup of this instant coffee. No mess to cleanup and it tastes great as well. What more can you ask for in a instant cup of coffee?!"}
