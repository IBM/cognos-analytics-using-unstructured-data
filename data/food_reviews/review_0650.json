It was not bad, it just didnt taste like  or have the texture of cappuccino.<br /><br />This stuff does indeed taste like gas station instatnt cappuccino but I would not expect a real cappuccino to come out of an instant coffee machine (which is really what the Kuerig is).  That is just not realistic.<br /><br />This product actually does taste like cappuccino and has the foam.  Considering its coming out of a K cup, that is good enough to impress me.  When I want real cappuccino, I will break out whole beans and my frother.  When I want a quick cappuccino fix, I will use this."}
