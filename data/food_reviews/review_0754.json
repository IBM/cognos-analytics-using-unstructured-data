I thought, what a great price for K-Cup coffee.<br />Ya right! When I opened the box I thought that the cups were very light. Of course their light, they are filled with instant coffee!<br />For the amount of \"instant\" coffee that I got for $10 I could have bought 2 jars at the same price and got 100 times the same type of coffee.<br />I expect REAL coffee when I pay around 50c a cup."}
