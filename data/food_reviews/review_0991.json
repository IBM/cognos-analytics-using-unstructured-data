I actually tried these on a whim because the brand name and images were so appealing. Thank goodness I did! I love the donut shop kcups! They are perfect for my morning coffee, full of flavor with out being too strong.<br /><br />I highly recommend you give this one a try! I can't wait to try some of their other kcup choices too."}
