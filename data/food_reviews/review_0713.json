It is NOT, I repeat NOT just coffee that sort of has a hint of flavor, or smells better than it tastes.  It's sweet and creamy, don't have to add a thing to it.  Great on a cold day, or just a special treat for yourself.  Has a delicate caramel flavor and good aroma.  I've been looking for something like this since I discovered the Chai Tea Latte (which is my all time favorite)."}
