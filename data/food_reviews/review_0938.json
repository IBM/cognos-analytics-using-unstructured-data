We've easily had to throw away half of the pods. The coffee grounds just burst out and sometimes just clog up the Keurig and nothing comes out. DO NOT BUY THESE! If there was an option to give zero stars I would. The coffee is not that great either for the pods that do work.<br />UPDATE 7/7/12: The company sent us free replacements and I'm happy to say we have had no issues with them. Coffee is pretty good too. Got to admire a company that reaches out to unhappy customers and fixes the problems. Given the effort they made I've updated my rating from 1 star to 5 stars."}
