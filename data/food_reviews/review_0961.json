The brewing performance was improved - one of the first eight passed through some grounds, but not a total blowout.  Found I had to brew a smaller cup than normal for acceptable flavor, and even so the coffee had a certain 'hollowness'.  Not sure if it was just weak coffee, or the result of their filter system."}
