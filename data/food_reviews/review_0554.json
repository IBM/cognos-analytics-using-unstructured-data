First, Starbucks list this item for $35.95 so there is no $21.05 savings. Next, add in the shipping cost and your saving is further erroded. The bottomline is that Amazon is not rewarding you with a 42% saving....With that said, I love brewed coffee and drink my coffee black. For an instant coffee VIA brand is probably one of the best on the market. The Italian Roast is labeled \"extra bold\" by Starbucks and indeed it is. This is not a very smooth coffee and has a robust taste. If you like a medium taste (ex. Colombia) you might want to give thought before buying the Italian Roast. Even though the Columbian is medium this coffee still has a rich flavor. An if you prefer a strong coffee (as I do) this is not the one. Last thing for those who drink brewed coffee (and especially black coffee) every morning. The VIA is NOT a substitute brand for your every morning coffee. This is fine as an emergency when freshly brewed coffee is not possible. Oh yes, I have purchased the VIA direct from Starbucks and the grocery store, the \"use by\" stamp on the coffee has been from four to eight months (grocery store). So, the shelf life the buyer sees depends on how long its been on the shelf of the seller and when you make the purchase. Would I purchase this product? Yes, but I would compare prices (at the grocery store-no shipping cost, Starbucks, etc.) before I purchase from Amazon."}
