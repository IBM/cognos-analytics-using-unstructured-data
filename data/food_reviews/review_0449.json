It's a little pricey in comparison to regular drip coffee, but I am willing to pay that price for not having to clean the coffee pot, grind beans, wait for it to brew, etc when I am in a hurry to get to work in the mornings. One packet makes a large cup of coffee. I use about 14 oz of water and that still has plenty of flavor. In fact, I am drinking a cup of it right now. ;-)"}
