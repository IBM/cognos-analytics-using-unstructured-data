I have now learned to squeeze the k-cup just slightly to see if the foil lid responds to the light pressure. If it bulges just a little, the lid is good. If it is loose, I pull the lid off and brew it in My K-Cup coffee filter so at least the coffee is not wasted. The coffee is very good. My favorite was Brooklyn Bridge Blend. But all of it was fresh and tasty. ]<br /><br />7 out of 36 cups are not sealed. I do not think the box was compressed in shipping causing some of the cups to burst. No cups were crunched. The BB box looks fine - undented. It was inside an Amazon box which also looked fine - all still-puffy airpillows inside. There was loose coffee in both boxes and coffee dust on  the k-cups and airpillows.<br /><br />The k-cups that have a good lid  look roughly made to me. The logo printing<br /> doesn't line up with the top of the cups. The edges of the foil is rough. Where the foil is sealed on the cup the foil feels bumpy... like loose coffee was not cleaned off the cup before the foil was applied.<br /><br />I haven't made any coffee yet. I will up date this review when I do tomorrow morning... but right now, already 7 cups down, I am not impressed.<br /><br />I rarely write bad reviews, but I do not want anyone else to be disappointed like I am right now."}
