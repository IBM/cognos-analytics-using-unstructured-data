The results are a very full-bodied, strong coffee(I use Costco's Kirkland brand Columbian Supremo) that I add just hot water and half and half to. Similar to a double shot Cafe Americano at an espresso bar.<br /><br />I am absolutely NOT a fan of Starbuck's overpriced and over roasted coffee. I also despise coffeemaker Folgers coffee, if I can avoid it! And other instant coffee tastes bitter and watery to me.<br /><br />However, these little packets are quick, pack anywhere--like a purse, glovebox or suitcase--and make a fascinatingly GOOD cup of coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, on the strong side but no \"Burnt\" taste, and close to freshly brewed coffee as -- sheesh, it tastes like a fresh brewed cup. I am impressed. I add water and my half and half and it's better than good. I love Columbian coffee and this is the flavor I hoped for.<br /><br />Starbucks has done this right!<br /><br />The Downside: The cost is really an issue. I paid $5+ at Starbucks for a 3 pack. Then I got a 3 pack at Walmart recently for $2.99. This offer gets you more for about 80 cents each, but for instant? So I give the VIA coffee a 4 star rating even at the cheaper price.<br /><br />The quality is there though, so I plan to get some for my business trips out of town (no more running out for an expensive espresso) or as a backup in my purse. But I still use my espresso maker for my everyday cup."}
