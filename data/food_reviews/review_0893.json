Seems it likes to make a real mess of my coffee maker with grounds all over the place. I have not had a problem with any other K-cup brand coffee, just this one, perhaps some problem with how they were made. The few time I could get one to work in all fairness the coffee was good, thats why I have purchased this before. I have sent a email to the company and will see how they respond, for now I would suggest holding off purchasing until the problem is resolved<br /><br />update: they responded to my email, i guess there was a batch problem afterall. Amazon shoud not ship the defective batches and return them to brooklyn. On the positive side they will be sending me replacement coffee. I will update again when new coffee arrives. I would say at least they have good customer service.<br /><br />Update 7-11-2012<br />I received my replacement shipment for the defective K cups that I mentioned above along with a nice bonus of sample k cups . Its hard to find a company anymore that stands behind their product but I can say 'Brooklyn Bean Roastery \" does bu responding quickly to my problem. Customer service is still alive and well, I'm sure the coffee will exceed my expectations, the customer service sure has."}
