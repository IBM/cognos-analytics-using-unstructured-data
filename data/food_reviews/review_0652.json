It still has enough coffee taste that you realize it does have some in it, but it's smooth and creamy like Hot Cocoa. I've become a quick fan, and like it so much that I'm gonna sign up for the subscribe & save to receive a box every two months. Since the coffee taste isn't too overpowering, it makes an amazing drink for a cold winter night. Perfect something to warm you up!<br /><br />P.S<br />Top it with some whip cream, DELICIOUS!"}
