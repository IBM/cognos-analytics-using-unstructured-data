Unlike some flavor additives for water (cough...Mio...cough), these are not overly sweet.  The flavor is very well-balanced and refreshing.  Unfortunately, the flavor doesn't really taste like tea at all.  For some people, this might be desirable, but I would imagine that most people buying this product would be expecting the green tea flavor to come through more strongly.  In addition, the mix is slow to dissolve.  It didn't seem that any amount of stirring/shaking would completely eliminate the powder.  Over time, the powder dissolves more on its own, but this is definitely not ideal for an instant drink mix.  Overall, I'd say this is worth a try, but not quite living up to the quality I'd hoped for."}
