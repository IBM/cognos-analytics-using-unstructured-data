Starbucks VIA  is delicious!  I have it every morning, upstairs, by simply heating water.<br /><br />Everyone who tastes VIA says the same thing, \"This is great coffee!\"  I never drink instant coffee - would rather skip coffee than have instant,  but someone gave me a cup of Starbucks VIA at their home because their coffee pot was broken and I loved it.<br /><br />I have noticed if I just tell people to take a sip when I make the first cup  - they light up - they don't/won't give the cup back so I make the next cup for me.  I was never a Starbucks person before,  but VIA is great.<br /><br />Try it just once!  I put my coffee pot away downstairs - put in a hot water dispenser and always have really good coffee or tea.<br /><br />Enjoy!"}
