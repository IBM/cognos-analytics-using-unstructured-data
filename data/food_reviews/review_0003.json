Flavor, of course, is a subjective matter, but I think the Honey and Strawberry Acai version is delicious. A box of these is a handy thing to have in an office desk drawer, or any location where you'd like to make only a glass or two. Green tea and acai are currently considered excellent for promoting good health. This product is fairly expensive if you want to make tea by the quart or half gallon, however."}
