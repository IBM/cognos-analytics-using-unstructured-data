Have used wtih no problem at 6 months after expiration date on package. Just seemed a little \"clumpy\" at that point but tasted fine.  Much better value per unit than smaller packaging.  I ordered off the Starbucks site directly at this price, didn't notice a short expiration so wonder if it is Amazon fulfillment issue?"}
