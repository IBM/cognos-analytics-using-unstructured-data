The price obviously was also very enticing.<br />When the coffee arrived, I carefully transferred the pods to a plastic ziploc bag.<br />So far, so good. I then proceeded to brew my first cup - all excited to have found something wonderful.<br />Well, the excitement ceased when the cup produced was pure black liquid with a flavor that was not pleasing to my palate - at all. Maybe if you like bitterness in a coffee without the pleasantness of a well-rounded rich coffee, then this is for you.<br />I found it not an experience to be repeated. I tried to like this coffee, but will go back to another brand. Sorry San Francisco Bay Coffee company - I really tried. The decaf French Roast was even less likable..."}
