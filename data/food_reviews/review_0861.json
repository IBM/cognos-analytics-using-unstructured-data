Yes, people from Brooklyn are colorful; however we do not necessarily scratch when it itches, we stand upright and don't need to use our knuckles when walking. We are not neanderthals. If you want some of those, go across the river to you-know-where.  Despite the silly name, I tried this coffee and it's excellent.  Really rich, lots of flavor, not bitter, and the fragrance makes you want to rub your cheek against your mug and whisper sweet nothings.<br /><br />The blend makes a great morning coffee, it smells and tastes just the way coffee is supposed to in the morning and makes you wish you were seated at a big farm table with platters of ham and eggs and country biscuits. You can drink it during the day because it's not acidic and you don't get a sour stomach or that overcoffeed taste in the back of your throat.  And it's rich enough to make it the perfect after dinner coffee too. (Add a little bit of condensed milk and it's dessert.)<br /><br />Keurig is not the best coffee maker in the world, but this particular blend works very well in the machine and is now my go-to K-Cup. Keurig's main benefit is that it's fast so there's no standing on one foot and tapping your head against the counter while waiting for the coffee to brew. With Fuhgeddaboudit, there's no sacrifice of flavor for that instant gratification.<br /><br />Some reviewers have had problems with the k-cup itself, but I haven't.  I'm on my third box and not one leaking or grounds-spewing incident has occured."}
