It is easy to mix up with a glass of water, and does not take long to dissolve.<br /><br />Why only 3 stars? Well, first because it really does not taste like tea, more like berry kool-aid. The second reason is that though the words \"tea & honey\" are splashed all over the product box and the packet, you'd expect that 1) it tastes a little like tea, 2) you could taste the honey, 3) honey is the only sweetener.  I've already talked about it failing point 1. You can faintly taste the honey - it's not overpowering, and was a nice taste. Point 2 in its favor. Now onto point 3; the ingredients are as follows: honey granules (sugar, honey), citric acid (provides tartness), green tea powder, hibiscus extract, sucralose (sweetener), maltodextrin (corn), natural flavor, blackberry juice solids, isomalt, soy lecithin, pomegranate juice solids. I see 3 sweeteners other than the honey granules: sucralose, maltodextrin, and isomalt. Point 3 against this product. Serving size is also misleading - you'd think one packet is one serving. Wrong, one packet is 2 servings. Not really a big deal, but it might be for some.<br /><br />I'll enjoy the drink, but not sure that I would be eager to go out and purchase it right away."}
