I've tried selecting the smallest size on my Keurig, but it still has that weak gas station taste.. now with smaller volume so I can chug it faster.<br /><br />I've gone through 10 of my 36 cups without any of the quality control issues others have talked about.  I just really don't like this roast.  For reference, I tend to enjoy Jet Fuel and Dark Magic roasts... and was hoping for something similar here.  I would give it one star for taste, but added a star because of the creative dispenser structure of the box and the cheaper price.  In this case, I did get what I paid for I guess."}
