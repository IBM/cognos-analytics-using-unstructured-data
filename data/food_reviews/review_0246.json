This coffee definitely had me at hello... and I knew it was a keeper when I served to guests and they exclaimed that it was the best cup of coffee that they have ever had. I just wish that it was available on subscribe and save like the other San Francisco Bay coffees.  I also really like the environmentally friendly pod.  I think the new packaging works even better than the all plastic cups.<br /><br />***Modified February 2012<br />Yeah!  This coffee is now available on subscribe and save!"}
