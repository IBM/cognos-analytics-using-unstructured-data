Brewed with the large mug (not tumbler) size on my Keurig B70.  It isn't as dark as Peet's from my ekobrew adapter, but that might be because Peet's does a darker roast.  Stronger than Green Mtn Colombian.  Maybe about the same as Dark Magic.<br /><br />Coworkers agreed that we'll probably buy more since we don't have to do any coupons from other vendors to get good coffee at this price."}
