I have tried almost all the Kcups out there and I prefer extra bold type coffee. The Brooklyn extra bold coffee was strong, but not too strong, and had a full bodied aroma and flavor which I really appreciated. The box design is pretty cute as the flap opens up to become a dispenser.<br /><br />I was concerned when I read the reviews about the Kcups exploding/imploding but I am happy to report that I have had no issues brewing the Kcups in the Keurig machine. Hopefully, future reviewers can confirm that the quality control issues are in the past for Brooklyn Kcups. I liked the coffee and will buy another box soon."}
