If you are a fast and furious VIA drinker this would not be a problem, but I only drink them at work, etc etc. I actually find a whole packet to be too strong; I prefer to use half a packet per cup, which is cheaper of course, and allows you to justify the occasional splurge on the \"real thing\"."}
