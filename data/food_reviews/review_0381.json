When I saw this, I liked the design of the cup and the price is much better too. I'm so glad I decided to give it a try. Doing a side by side comparison, Fog Chaser wins hands down! If you like a bold cup that lingers on your tongue and hold up under creamer too (I use unsweetened coconut milk), you will be happy you tried this coffee. Oh! A huge added bonus of the new environmentally friendly K Cup design is that you get that heavenly coffee aroma from the minute you open the vacuum sealed bag! You don't have to wait until its brewing to \"wake up and smell the coffee!\" :)"}
