I diluted it in water (dilutes fairly easily) and then added ice cubes for an icy cold drink.<br /><br />Each box comes with ten individually wrapped packets. The corner of each packet is pre-cut, so it is easier to open and you don't have to hunt for hard to find perforations. Each packet is good for a 16oz drink. If you find it too rich, you can always increase the amount of water or use one packet to make drinks for multiple people.<br /><br />One packet has 10 calories, all sugars. There is no other nutritional value on the label.<br /><br />If you are cautious about artificial sweeteners, this one has sucralose.<br /><br />The green tea is decaf, and indeed I did not feel a caffeine kick.<br /><br />The outside box is nice and colorful, but the drink definitely doesn't taste as good as it looks in the picture.<br /><br />The bottom of the outside box and the individual packets show an expiration date, but it is not written in a straightforward fashion from a consumer's perspective.<br /><br />The overall rating is closer to 3.5 stars out of five, but closer to a 4 than a 3. It gets bonus points for reasonable taste and convenience, but sucralose brings it down."}
